    ground no stall is drawn on, so the count ran past it too. broad_st_greenwood claimed 31 stalls
    over 28 drawn, and 8 over 6 in the two-way proposal - a label reading "parking 8 stalls" beside
    six ticked stalls, with nothing to catch it because both readers shared the arithmetic and
    neither read the ground. src/metrics.py:marked_stall_runs is the fix and this is the check.

    THE DRAWN SIDE IS COUNTED FROM THE TICKS, deliberately, so the two derivations stay
    independent: a pair of consecutive ticks exactly one stall apart with no entrance between them
    is a stall, and nothing else is. Chaining on the pitch alone would fuse the two ticks either
    side of a narrow entrance whenever that gap happened to land near one stall length, which is
    why the opening spans are consulted rather than trusted to be far from 22 ft.

    On the wide sheet for the same reason the clearance test above is: at 1x no site draws a stall
    near an entrance at all, so this passes over nothing.

    Read off the source rather than off a scenario, because several markings are real but
    conditional - a taper is only built where a zone tapers, and no current proposal has one at

    Both modules, because markings are moving out of paint.py's per-treatment blocks and onto the
    treatments themselves (Treatment.paint). This test caught that move the first time a marking
    left: CORNER_HATCH_FILL is emitted by CornerHatching now, and searching paint.py alone called
    it stale.

    EVERY FILE OF THE TREATMENTS PACKAGE, walked rather than named. inspect.getsource on a package
    returns its __init__.py alone, so when treatments became a package this read the re-export list
    and called eight genuinely-emitted markings stale. Globbing the directory means a new submodule
    is covered the day it is added, which a hand-written list of the seven would not be.

    RECURSIVELY, because a submodule may itself be a package. `glob` stopped at the top level and
    so stopped reading the bikeways the day they were split into one, and every marking only they
    emit went unchecked - masked meanwhile by the pre-split bikeways.py, which was left behind

    This is the property the dict collapse rested on. Every treatment used to write one of

    could in principle have been a partial record - a policy that edited the state directly
    rather than applying a treatment would leave the list short, and nothing would say so.
    complete_centerlines did exactly that until it was migrated.

    So: take the design a real scenario produces, apply its recorded treatments to a fresh
    baseline in order, and require the result to be the same design.

    WHAT "THE SAME DESIGN" MEANS is narrower after the collapse, and that narrowing is the
    result rather than a weakening. The dicts this used to compare are gone, so the parameters a
    renderer reads ARE the treatment list - there is no second store left to disagree with it,
    and the failure this test was written to catch is now unconstructible rather than merely
    unobserved. Comparing the paint would be tautological for the same reason: paint is a pure
    function of the treatments, the modelled street and the OSM facts from_model seeds.

    What is left is the MODELLED STREET, which is the one thing a treatment still writes:
    AddCurbExtension moves a kerb line and re-cuts the corner that kerb feeds, and
    SetCornerRadius re-cuts a corner. A policy that moved a kerb itself instead of applying one
    of those would leave a design replay cannot rebuild, and that is what this fails on.

    state.notes is deliberately NOT compared. A policy that emits several treatments explains
    itself in a note of its own - apply_osm_parking says which OSM tag produced each kerb's
    markings - and that sentence belongs to the policy, not to any one treatment, so replaying
