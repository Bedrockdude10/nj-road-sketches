"""A two-way bike lane on ONE side of a street, and the asymmetry that forces.

Every other treatment here is symmetric about the leg centerline, because NJDOT's alignment
is the datum every offset, stop bar and crossing frame is measured from. A two-way lane
breaks that: it takes 12-15 ft out of one kerbside and nothing out of the other, so the two
travel lanes no longer straddle the alignment - they sit off it, and the double yellow
between them moves with them.

The main README said this was "a real design, but not one this pipeline can draw". What
makes it drawable without moving the datum is that the datum does not have to be the middle
of the travel lanes: the alignment stays exactly where it is, every station and crossing
stays where it is, and the cross-section is simply described asymmetrically about it.

    """Both halves handed to TwoWayBikeLane must be numbers measured somewhere on the leg.

    They answer different questions and bind at DIFFERENT STATIONS, and each side's own minimum
    is the answer to both. `near_half_ft` is the datum every kerbside mark is placed off, so it
    has to be the near kerb's own minimum or the section overruns the kerb where it pinches.
    `far_half_ft` is what the opposing travel lane is measured against, so it has to be the far
    kerb's own minimum or the divider is placed on width that kerb does not have.

    THE SUM IS THE TRAP, AND IT SHIPPED. This returned `min(near + far) - min(near)` for one
    session, on the argument that the two kerbs pinch at different stations so pairing their
    minima describes a cross-section that exists nowhere. That is true of the STREET and false of
    the DRAWING: the section's inner edge is held on the alignment at `min(near) - section_ft`
    (place.py, lane_edge_line - only the lane's own two edges hug the kerb), so where the near
    kerb runs wider than its minimum the surplus is drawn as bike-lane hatching on THAT kerb and
    never reaches the travel way. The drawn travel way is `min(near) - section_ft + far(s)`, whose
    minimum over the leg is exactly the two independent minima. Crediting it with the sum
    promoted w_broad_st_northeast from the constrained rung to the full one and put the divider
    9.45 ft toward a far kerb that pinches to 17.30 ft - a 7.88 ft travel lane on a rural
    arterial with trucks, at 49 of 67 stations, drawn and shipped.

    MEASURED OVER THE BOTH-TRACED STRETCH, NOT OVER THE LEG, so neither half equals
    `narrowest_half_width_ft` on the same side and asserting that they do is a false
    equivalence - it fails by 5.59 ft on louellen_st_west, whose far kerb is traced well past
    where the near one stops. travel_way_profile clips to the intersection of the two spans
    because outside it one of the two numbers is an extrapolation of a kerb nobody traced, and
    that clip is the whole reason the pair is a cross-section at all.

    The last assertion is what keeps the second honest. Where the two kerbs pinch at the same
    station, min(near) + min(far) equals min(near + far) and this test cannot tell the two rules
    apart - SKILLS 0a's rule about a check that cannot fail, applied to the check itself.
