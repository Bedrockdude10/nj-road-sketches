    """A whole-leg minimum let one narrow tail veto a kerb that has room almost everywhere.

    w_broad_st_southwest's left kerb, at ROAD_SKETCHES_FRAME_SCALE=3.0 - the scale the corridor's own
    checked-in renders actually use, confirmed by matching output/wbroad_louellen's committed
    frame.radius_m against every candidate scale rather than assuming it (tests/conftest.py's
    WIDE_FRAME_SCALE=2.5 is the suite's own invariant-sweep convention and is a DIFFERENT number)
    - holds an 11 ft travel lane for 336 of its 390 traced feet and pinches inside it only over
    the last stretch. Judged by narrowest_half_width_ft over the WHOLE leg - what
    hold_travel_lane_at_target used before _lane_target_reach_ft existed - that one pinch reads
    back as "the street has nothing spare" and NOTHING is drawn on the other 336 ft either, which
    is exactly the bug SKILLS 0a and 0b describe for the two-way section: a single station
    deciding a whole approach.

    Asked per station instead, the lane (or marking) has to reach as far as the kerb actually
    holds it and refuse the tail by name - not run the whole leg (which would draw past where
    the kerb narrows) and not silently draw nothing (which is what shipped and drew no hatching
    on this kerb at all).
