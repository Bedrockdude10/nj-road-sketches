# Metres, so this is a millimetre - far below any distance this project draws or argues about,
# and coarse enough that the same arithmetic in a different order lands on the same number.

# with a tolerance, so it sits a decade coarser to stay off the rounding boundary.
#
# THIS IS NOW THE SECOND ROUNDING, not the first: the export itself quantises to
# coords.EXPORT_DECIMALS (1 um) so its diffs mean something, and this digests that. Rounding
# twice is not the same as rounding once, and one vertex found the seam - broad_st_east's
# centreline paint is 21.396500330568525 m raw, which is 21.397 at 3 places, but 21.3965 at 6
# places, which is an exact tie that round-half-to-even sends to 21.396. A 1 mm move in the
# digest, no move in the geometry.
#
# Left as it is rather than papered over. Quantising first makes the pipeline DETERMINISTIC at
# this precision, so this can only bite once per vertex ever - whereas the raw value drifting

# single 1 mm coordinate and nothing else, this is the reason to check for first.
