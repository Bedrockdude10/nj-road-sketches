"""Static checks for the errors that only surface on a path nobody ran.

This exists because of a specific miss. Collapsing a multi-line import in
scripts/build_all.py dropped `fetch_buildings`, which is referenced only under
`--render-3d`. Every test passed, a full 2D build passed, and the break surfaced minutes
later in a worker process - as a NameError wrapped in a ProcessPoolExecutor traceback,
which is about the least legible way an error can arrive.

Nothing dynamic was needed to catch it: a static pass reports an undefined name in under a
second, without importing anything or running Blender. That is the right shape of guard for
a repo with slow, rarely-exercised branches (3D rendering, the network paths, one scenario
per site that only one site defines).

Two checkers run here, both configured at the repo root and both treated the same way - if the
tool cannot run, that is a failure, not a pass:

  * RUFF (ruff.toml), over every .py file, for what one file gets wrong on its own.
  * IMPORT-LINTER (.importlinter), over the import graph, for what no single file can show you -
    a blender script reaching into the venv, a config read dragging in shapely, geometry
    importing the thing that draws it.

Two things changed when ruff replaced a `python -m pyflakes` subprocess:

  * FINDINGS ARE RULE CODES, NOT SUBSTRINGS. The old version decided what was fatal by
    matching "undefined name" against stdout, so a reworded message would have silently
    retired the guard.
  * A MISSING CHECKER IS A FAILURE, NOT A PASS. This is the bug that mattered. pyflakes was
    never in requirements.txt - it happened to be in the working venv. On any other machine
    `python -m pyflakes` exited 1 with its complaint on STDERR; the old code read exit 1 as
    "ran fine, had findings", found an empty stdout, and reported success. The guard against
    silent breakage was itself silently broken. So: the checker is pinned in requirements.txt
    - the same one every other dependency is in, deliberately not a separate dev file - and if
    it cannot be run this file FAILS and says how to install it.
