"""Building heights from the assessor's storey count, rather than one number for the whole town.

OSM gave this project real building outlines and no heights at all - 0 of the borough's 1150
building ways carry `height`, 7 carry `building:levels` - so every building was extruded to the
same 7 m default. The MOD-IV tax list has been in data/ the whole time with a storey count per
parcel, sitting unused in data/ and described in the README as "joinable by PIN, not currently
used" - see src/sources/assessor.py for the join and how it is ordered against OSM's own tags.
