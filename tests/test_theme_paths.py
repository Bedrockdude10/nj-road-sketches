"""The texture and model paths in a geometry export name files, and a name has to work on the
machine that READS it.

Every one of the 65 committed exports carried 19 absolute paths from one laptop -
`/Users/danny/.../output/.textures/asphalt_01/4k/asphalt_01_Diffuse_4k.jpg` - pointing into a
gitignored directory that is re-fetched on demand. On any other checkout they named nothing, and
nothing said so: blender_materials.make_textured_material falls back to a flat colour per
unreadable image and import_gltf_template returns None, so a clone rendered untextured asphalt
and reported success. That is the same failure shape as a stale export - a plausible wrong
picture - and the fix is the same, which is to make the artifact not depend on where it was made.
