"""THE CHECKPOINT FOR STEP 2 of docs/network-model.md: a road that runs the length of the borough.

tests/test_network.py established that a road through ONE junction reproduces the per-leg widths.
This file asks the same question of a road that spans several junctions and carries on past them
along NJDOT's alignment, plus the two things a corridor has to get right that a 300 ft road cannot
get wrong:

  * it must not SKIP a junction. Broad St resolves as one road across all three modelled ones, and
    the axis has to run one way over all 2,800+ ft of it, not just through each node.
  * every figure taken off it must carry the coverage it was measured over. That is asserted
    STRUCTURALLY - Coverage has no defaults and Figure cannot be built without one - rather than by
    matching strings in the output, because the failure being guarded against is a future question
    added without a denominator, and a string test would pass for that until someone read it.

The numbers here are deliberately PROPERTIES, not values. The committed OSM snapshot is a moment in
a survey that is still being traced (the live cache already has ~50% more kerb along Broad St than
the fixture does), so a test that pinned "1,227 ft traced" would fail on the next refresh for the
best possible reason. What must not change is that the road is one road, that its widths still
agree with the legs', and that nothing is counted without saying over how much.

    MAY change the width. A treatment applies to the street in the drawing, so a sheet that shows
    more street is asking the question of more street: W Broad's southwest approach measures
    20.32 ft over 130 ft and 16.58 ft over 325 ft, off a real pinch 318 ft out, and takes NACTO's
    constrained rung on the sheet that shows it. Both drawings are honest about what they depict -
    the alternative was a section sized on the short span and drawn over the long one, which is
    how the same leg came to carry 63.6 ft of amputated paint.

    MAY NOT change whether it is protected. The buffer is the rung that never gives on this
    facility (see BROAD_ST_TWO_WAY_BIKEWAY), and it is what the flex posts stand in - so a
    painted lane in one picture and a protected one in another is a difference in the PROPOSAL,
    not in the sheet. That is the half of the old frame-invariance assertion worth keeping.

    MAY NOT change whether the approach carries one AT ALL, which is the assertion below that
    two sheets were not enough to catch. This swept 1x and 2.5x, passed both, and the southwest
    approach still went bare at 3x - so the property was pinned at the two scales that happened
    to agree. Three sheets is not a principle either; what makes it enough here is that the third
    is the one the reader asked for, and the mechanism is now measured per station rather than
    per sheet (see AddTwoWayBikeLane.to_ft and TwoWayBikeway._reach_on).

    The 3x failure is worth keeping as a number, because nothing about it looked like a rounding
    problem from the outside: 168 of that leg's 169 sampled stations held the section, station
    363.6 measured 31.813 ft between kerbs against the 31.820 the rung wanted, and the 0.0036 ft
    that left each travel lane short of MIN_TRAVEL_LANE_BESIDE_TWO_WAY_FT denied a protected
    bikeway over all 335 traced feet. That is a fortieth of an inch deciding a corridor.

    THIS IS THE BUG CLASS, AND THE SHAPE OF IT IS THE POINT. A fit judged once for a whole

    sampled stations held the section on the 3x sheet, station 363.6 was 0.0036 ft per travel lane
    short, and the approach went bare - so the reader got a corridor that arrives at the junction
    and stops, and nothing in the drawing said why. Asked per station instead, the same leg carries
    a protected lane for 283 of its 335 traced feet and REFUSES the tail by name.

    A REFUSAL IS AN OUTPUT, NOT A PRINT STATEMENT, which is the second half of this. The span, the
    reason and the measurement go on the design (DesignState.refuse) because
    BikewayReachesTheEndOfItsKerb is fatal and has to tell a stretch that was measured and
    declined from one the paint quietly stopped on - and it cannot read stdout.

    Driven with a ONE-RUNG ladder, because the real ladder's job is to make this rare: the
    step-down buys length rather than trading it, and on this sheet the full rung stops at 285.8 ft
    where the constrained one carries to 337.6 of the kerb's 54.4-389.9.

    THE LAST ASSERTION HERE USED TO BE THAT THE LADDER COVERED THE WHOLE LEG, which held only
    while the travel way was measured as min(near + far) - a figure that credits the lanes with
    room the drawing spends on bike-lane hatching at the OTHER kerb, see
    governing_half_widths_ft. Measured as drawn, the last 50.2 ft of this 3x leg is 0.06 ft per
    lane under the floor, so the ladder refuses a tail here too - 16.3 ft of that once fitted and
    lost to the same function's second rule, that the far kerb is measured over the whole leg
