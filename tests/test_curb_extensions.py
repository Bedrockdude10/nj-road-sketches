"""Curb extensions: the treatment that shortens a crossing, and the one that only looks like it.

The distinction is the whole reason this file exists. `bump_out` claimed in its docstring that
"the curb physically extends into the corner" and had no test and no scenario, so the claim was
never checked. It re-cuts the corner ARC between two curb lines that stay exactly where they
are, which at these junctions moves no crossing at all - the crossings sit 21-42 ft out, past
the corner. Both facts are pinned below, because the failure mode is a proposal that renders
beautifully and shortens nothing.
