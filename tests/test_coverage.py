"""The guard that says a render dropped something the surveyor recorded.

Every test here is about one property: what is in the frame is in the drawing. The reason it
needs its own guard is that no other check in this repo can fail on it - src/checks.py asks
whether the geometry we built is right, and a feature that was never built has no geometry to be
wrong about, so a render that omits six of Broad & Greenwood's ten mapped crossings passes every
invariant in the suite and looks finished.

Two of these tests are deliberately CONTROL CASES rather than bug reports. A checker that reports
every layer as broken is worth nothing, so the kerbs layer - already fixed in `cb9c8b6`, drawn at
the whole area's kerbs - has to come out clean, and the kerb ramps layer has to come out clean at 1x
and dirty at 2.5x on the same code. If either of those ever goes the other way, the number in the
failing test is the least of the problems.

And the crossings assertions are split on purpose. One asserts the RELATIONSHIP - the gap is the
surveyed crossings the drawing does not contain, measured independently here - and is written to
hold unchanged once stream A of docs/network-renderer-plan.md draws all ten. The other pins
today's 6-of-10 and says in its own name that it is expected to fail.
