"""A crossing the surveyor traced inside the frame is drawn, and drawn from its own geometry.

Every test here is one half of the defect docs/network-renderer-plan.md measures at Broad &
Greenwood with ROAD_SKETCHES_FRAME_SCALE=2.5 - 10 traced crossings inside a 431.2 ft frame, 4 of them
drawn, the 4 that happen to match this junction's modelled legs:

  * WHAT IS COLLECTED. The frame decides, not the legs. At 1x Greenwood's frame contains exactly
    the 4 that are drawn today, which is why nothing looked wrong until the frame was widened.
  * WHAT IS DRAWN FROM. The traced way itself, so a crossing at a junction with no legs is still
    drawable, and one with legs still lands where the per-leg code puts it (0.2-2.7 ft across the
    four sites) rather than being rebuilt off a station and a skew.
  * WHAT IS NOT DRAWN. A crossing with no `crossing:markings` tag gets no paint. The existing
    per-leg path reads that tag through `OSM_MARKINGS_TO_STYLE.get(tag, "lines")`, so an unmarked
    crossing comes out wearing two transverse lines nobody surveyed - a drawing that makes a claim
    about the street on the strength of a missing tag.

The numbers below are the committed OSM snapshot's (tests/fixtures/osm_cache), so a change in them
is a change in the survey and should be read as one.

    rotated across-axis because neither renderer stretches that one. Splitting that stretch across
    the callers is what went wrong - the plan view applied its own 1/cos to the offset and
    src/render/export.py exported the raw figure, so on louellen_st_west's -44 deg crossing the 3D
    bar stood 2.15 ft the wrong side of the centreline, straight through the opposing lanes, while
    the plan view was correct. Nothing compared the two, which is why this test exists and not
    just the fix.

    Checked as geometry rather than as arithmetic: project the near end back onto the alignment's
    own perpendicular and it must be exactly `inner_ft` out. That holds in both views because both
