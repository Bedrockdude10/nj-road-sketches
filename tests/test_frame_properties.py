"""Property-based tests for the station/offset frame (src/geometry/model/).

Every measurement this project makes goes through this frame: a leg's centerline defines
"distance along" and "signed distance from", and every kerb vertex, crosswalk bar, stop line
and parking stall is placed and re-measured in it. It is also the piece with the most edge
cases per line, and the four sites exercise a handful of real centerlines - two straight, two
with one kink each. The bugs its own docstrings record (a point behind the junction claiming
the opposite leg's kerb; a vertex placed at station 44.0 reading back at 41.59 across a 4.5 deg
bend) are all shape-dependent, and the shapes that produce them are the shapes nobody typed in.

So these tests state the frame's contracts and let hypothesis look for the shape that breaks
them, rather than asserting numbers off the four centerlines that happen to exist. They are
about the transform in isolation - no site data, no OSM, no config - which is why this file
runs in milliseconds and needs none of the fixtures the rest of the suite does.

The contracts, in the order they are tested:

  1. A point ON the centerline measures offset 0, at its own arc length.
  2. Stations increase monotonically along the line, INCLUDING past both ends - the property
     that keeps a station behind the junction negative.
  3. Offset is signed and antisymmetric about the centerline: left is positive.
  4. On a straight centerline the transform and its inverse round-trip exactly, at any offset.
  5. On a bent one they do not, and place_in_measured_frame's whole contract is that it is
     never WORSE than the naive placement it corrects. That is the invariant that holds even
     inside the fold, where a round-trip flatly does not.
  6. Away from a kink, that same placement measures back to within the tolerance a painted
     dimension is held to.
  7. AT a kink - the case the placement code exists for - it is still within that tolerance at
     the two angles the real centerlines bend by. Fixed inputs, not sampled ones.

(5) and (6)/(7) are deliberately a pair: (5) is the contract that holds everywhere including
inside a fold, and (7) is the one with teeth. These were checked by mutation - breaking the
correction (removing it, flipping its sign) is caught only by (7), because the sampled cases in
(6) are scoped away from the discontinuity where the correction does its work, and because a
bad correction is not necessarily WORSE than no correction, which is all (5) asks.

One known gap, stated rather than papered over: replacing "keep whichever trial measures
closest" with "keep the last trial" is NOT caught by anything here. With the current two
correction passes the last trial is as good as the best in every case these tests reach, so the
guard is currently unobservable from outside. It matters at pass counts above two.
