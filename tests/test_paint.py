"""Curbside paint: strips, stall ticks, tapers, and the invariant that keeps them on the road.

Every test here is a bug that shipped, and they share one cause with the traced-curb bugs in
test_traced_curbs.py: code that was correct while a curb was a symmetric offset of the
centerline, and was never revisited once curbs became traced kerbs. A traced kerb starts
13-47 ft out, runs at its own bearing, sometimes carries on 78 ft past the end of the leg,
and is sometimes closer to the centerline than the leg's nominal half-width. Any code that
addresses it by ARC LENGTH, or that trusts the nominal half-width, is wrong on real geometry
and looks fine on a synthetic straight leg - so the legs below are built to have those
properties.
