"""What a design ACHIEVES, as numbers - and that the numbers come off the drawn geometry.

Against a synthetic junction rather than a site, for the reason tests/test_checks.py gives:
these run in milliseconds and cannot be broken by re-tracing a kerb in OSM. It also means
they run without data/, which the whole-site tests need and skip without.

The thing being pinned throughout is that a metric is MEASURED off what the scenario drew -
the two-pass crossing reaches, the paint pieces actually put down - and not recomputed from
the nominal inputs. A number recomputed from the config would agree with the drawing only by
coincidence, and would keep agreeing after a treatment moved the kerb.
