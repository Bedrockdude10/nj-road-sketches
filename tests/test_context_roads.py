"""The streets around the junction, and how much of each one was actually measured.

The bug these are written against: a wide render showed a cross of asphalt floating on grass,
because the exported kerbs were the corner-fit's NEAR set (within 80 ft of the centre) and
8,938 ft of traced kerb within 600 m of Broad & Greenwood went on the floor. So the two things
pinned here are that tracing REACHES the drawing, and that a street reports honestly whether
its edges were traced or guessed.

Synthetic geometry throughout, apart from the marked site tests - a straight street with kerbs
put exactly where the test wants them is the only way to assert a measured width is the width
that was traced.
