"""Test configuration: hermetic by default.

Two things make the suite reproducible and fast:

  * The OSM cache is pointed at tests/fixtures/osm_cache, a committed snapshot of the
    Overpass responses for the four sites. Tests therefore see a fixed OSM state.
  * ROAD_SKETCHES_OFFLINE is set, so any fetch that ISN'T satisfied from that snapshot raises
    OfflineCacheMiss instead of quietly reaching the network. A test that silently depends
    on Overpass's uptime and current replication state is worse than no test - during one
    editing session two consecutive live fetches of the same junction returned 4 tactile
    pads and then 0.

Refresh the snapshot with:  cp output/.cache/*.json tests/fixtures/osm_cache/

# NEAR THE RENDER IS NOT THE RENDER, which is why this is one constant and not a number per module:
# it was 2.2 while output/ was drawn at 2.5, and a leg is 41 ft longer at 2.5x, which is where W
# Broad's kerb pinch to 16.58 ft lies - so every test on the 2.2 fixture was measuring a sheet
# nobody looks at.
#
# AND IT IS NO LONGER output/'s SCALE. `build_all.py --frame-scale` takes it on the command line and
# the committed renders are 3x (legs 387-390 ft against 130 ft at 1x), so the honest reading of the
# rule above is 3.0. It is 2.5 because raising it fails two tests that are their own piece of work,
# neither about the corridor: test_every_traced_crossing_inside_the_frame_is_returned hardcodes
# 431.2 ft, which IS this constant times a 1x radius and should be derived from it; and
# test_an_intersecting_approach_gets_no_driveway_apron finds ebroad_princeton's
# princeton_ave_south/right reaching `driven` but not `intersection_mouths` - a real gap that only
# a sheet wide enough to pull that cross street in can see. Both are the frame-keyed coupling the
