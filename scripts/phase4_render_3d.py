"""
Phase 4 (stretch): export existing-conditions + one named proposal's geometry
for a site, then drive headless Blender (`blender --background --python
blender_scene.py`) to render both as presentation-ready 3D stills.

Usage: python scripts/phase4_render_3d.py [--site broad_st_greenwood] [--scenario build_demo_scenario]

A site can define any number of proposals in its scenarios.py (see
sites/README.md); pass the function name via --scenario to render a specific
one (e.g. --scenario build_proposal_a_paint_only). Output files are named
after it (geometry_<label>.json, phase4_render_<label>.png), except the
default scenario which keeps the original *_existing/*_proposed names.

Requires Blender on PATH, or set BLENDER_BIN to the executable
(e.g. /Applications/Blender.app/Contents/MacOS/Blender on macOS).
