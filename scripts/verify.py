"""The whole verification loop in one command, so a change costs one round trip.

Run by hand the loop is eight commands - export the before side, export the after side, diff
them, run the suite - and, worse, eight judgements, the last of which is always "which of
these failures were already here?". This runs all of it at once and prints one verdict.

    scripts/verify.py --no-tests            # THE LOOP: six sites, both sides, ~22 s
    scripts/verify.py --no-tests --site broad_st_greenwood    # one junction, ~6 s
    scripts/verify.py --site X -k traced_curbs   # ...and the tests that could see it, ~20 s
    scripts/verify.py                       # everything, serially: ~5 min
    scripts/verify.py --base main           # against another revision
    scripts/verify.py --record              # re-record the known-failure baseline

ONE STEP AT A TIME, AND WHY. Every step here is a subprocess, and running the exports beside
the suite overlapped nicely on paper: 72 s against 76 s serial. It is off anyway. This is a
36 GB machine with Blender, an editor and more than one agent session on it, and the operator
was watching it hit OOM while the per-worker measurements (0.21 GB an export worker, 0.27 GB a
pytest worker) said there was room to spare. A four-second saving is not worth a run that
cannot be trusted to finish, so the default is serial everywhere - `--jobs` buys the
parallelism back for the suite when you know the machine is quiet.

WHY THE BASELINE. A suite you did not turn red costs more than a slow one: every run you have
to work out again which failures are yours. So the failing set is recorded (in
output/.verify/baseline.json) and every run reports NEW, KNOWN and FIXED against it. NEW is
the only number that says anything about the change in front of you. Re-record with --record
once you have decided the red you inherited is not yours to fix - and note that a baseline is
a claim about somebody else's mess, so it is stamped with the revision and time it was taken.

Both halves of that comparison are taken against the tests that ACTUALLY RAN, never against
the whole baseline, because -k deselects most of the suite and a skip runs nothing either.
Compared against the whole baseline, `-k traced_curbs` congratulated itself with FIXED 9 for
nine goldens it had not so much as executed. They are reported as NOT RUN instead: the honest
answer, which is that this run says nothing about them.

WHY THE INPUTS ARE WIRED IN TWO WAYS. The before side runs in a git worktree at --base, and
README's loop warns you to symlink the gitignored data/ into it or every run dies in 0.6 s and
you read that as a result. This does both: ROAD_SKETCHES_DATA_DIR and ROAD_SKETCHES_OSM_CACHE are passed
as absolute paths out of THIS checkout, AND data/ is symlinked into the worktree - pointing at
the committed clip, not at the 391 MB download. Belt and braces because the env var is only
honoured by revisions that know about it: run this against a base that predates
src/sources/data_loader.py's ROAD_SKETCHES_DATA_DIR and it reads plain data/, finds nothing, and
reports a crash where you were looking for a geometry diff. Either route lands on the same
bytes, which is the only way the diff means "my code moved this" and not "the inputs moved".

The worktree lives in the system temp directory, NOT under the repo: git supports a worktree
nested inside its own checkout, but a second full copy of src/ inside the project is a copy
every editor, indexer and file watcher will find. It is reused between runs (`git checkout
--detach` on the second call), so only the first run pays for creating it.
