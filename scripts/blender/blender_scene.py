"""
Phase 4: headless Blender scene builder + renderer for one or more geometry
exports produced by scripts/phase4_export_geometry.py (or phase4_render_3d.py).

Not run with the project's normal Python - invoke via Blender's own
interpreter, which has no network access / requests / this project's venv.
Every real asset (textures, the streetlight model) is fetched beforehand in
the venv (src/render/theme.py) and passed in as local file paths via the
JSON - this script only ever reads files, never fetches them. Accepts any
number of <geometry.json> <output.png> pairs, all rendered in one Blender
process (each launch has ~1-1.5s of fixed startup overhead - paying it once
for N renders instead of N times is the single biggest lever for reducing
total render time):

  blender --background --python scripts/blender/blender_scene.py -- \\
      output/geometry_existing.json output/phase4_render_existing.png \\
      output/geometry_proposed.json output/phase4_render_proposed.png

This file is the entry point + top-level scene assembly only - the actual
geometry-building code is split across sibling modules in this same
directory (plain local imports work fine under Blender's bundled Python, no
venv needed):
  blender_materials.py   flat-color and PBR-textured material builders
  blender_geometry.py    generic mesh helpers (extrude a ring, stripe rects)
  blender_crosswalks.py  the 3 painted crosswalk styles + dashed centerlines
  blender_props.py       street furniture: streetlights, signage, traffic
                          signals, trees - one builder function per prop type

# The new paint-only overlay markings (lane narrowing, corner hatching, mountable apron) sit on top
# of EXISTING_MARKING_HEIGHT_M + this gap, NOT exactly at either that or PAVEMENT_HEIGHT_M - two
# surfaces at the exact same height are coincident/coplanar, which renders as flickering z-fighting
# (confirmed by an isolated test: a marking placed with zero gap above the pavement rendered as a
# visibly tessellated mess even as a flat, zero-height plane, ruling out "thin geometry aliasing" as
# the cause; a lane-narrowing stripe overlapping a crosswalk's footprint needed the SAME fix again
# relative to the crosswalk's own top height, not just the pavement's). ~1cm of clearance is
# imperceptible at this render's scale but enough to give the depth buffer an unambiguous answer.
#
# Separately, EXISTING_MARKING_Z_BASE=0 (the crosswalk/centerline/stop-bar layer's OLD z_base) had
# its own bug even though its 0.06 top height was never coincident with anything: z_base=0 meant its
# bottom fully overlapped the pavement's own 0-0.05 volume rather than sitting on top of it. That,
# combined with this camera's near/far clip range being far wider than the scene needed (see
# setup_camera_and_light) and so starving the depth buffer of precision at this camera's distance,
# produced a torn/tessellated look on thin, elongated shapes like a crosswalk line - confirmed by an
# isolated test. Fixed by both lifting z_base to sit flush on the pavement's top (see
# blender_crosswalks.py:EXISTING_MARKING_Z_BASE) and tightening the camera's clip range.

# cosmetic difference: 39 of the 65 exports committed at the time predated these four, so one drew

# `frame` gone this script computed a camera extent of its own from the pavement, which

    # so a curved line needs add_paint_polyline instead (drawing every
    # consecutive segment) or it silently collapses into a straight diagonal.
    # add_paint_polyline, not add_paint_line(line[0], line[-1]): these are sampled polylines
    # that follow the traced kerb, and drawing the chord between their endpoints throws away

    # the painted lane edge inside the 11 ft it is supposed to mark, and to pull the line off
    # the hatching it is supposed to bound. The hatch strokes and stall ticks below really are
    # two-point segments, so add_paint_line is right for those.
    # EVERY WHITE MARKING IN ONE MESH, and the yellow ones in another. What this replaced was a
    # loop per channel calling add_paint_polyline, which called add_paint_line per SEGMENT, which
    # built an object each: a 130 ft lane edge sampled every 2 ft became 64 objects, its channel
    # became 1,209, and a wide render's scene held 3,753 objects for 842 JSON items. Batched, it is
    # two. See blender_geometry.MeshBatch, and src/render/plan_view.py:_draw for the same argument
    # winning the same 156x in matplotlib.

    # Grouped by MATERIAL rather than by channel, because that is the only thing a merge has to
    # respect - a mesh carries one material, and every white marking shares one. The channel
    # distinctions above it (which line is a lane edge, which a stall tick) are decided upstream in
    # src/geometry/markings.py and are already spent by the time the geometry arrives here.

    # POLYLINES, NOT CHORDS. polyline_rings walks every segment, so a sampled arc still curves; the
