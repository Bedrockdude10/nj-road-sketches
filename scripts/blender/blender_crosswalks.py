# Existing-conditions markings (crosswalks, centerlines, stop bars) are a thin
# decal that sits flush on TOP of the pavement slab, not a thick block whose
# bottom coincides with the pavement's own bottom at z=0. The original version
# of this file used z_base=0, height=0.06 for all of these - the marking's
# bottom fully overlapped the pavement's own volume instead of sitting on top
# of it. That coincidence, combined with this render's camera having a far
# wider near/far clip range than the scene needed (see blender_scene.py:
# setup_camera_and_light), was confirmed (by an isolated test eliminating
# other candidate causes one at a time) to starve the depth buffer of enough
# precision at this camera's distance, producing a torn/tessellated look on
# thin, elongated shapes like a crosswalk line. Both fixes were needed
