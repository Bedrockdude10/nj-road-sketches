"""Shared low-level Blender mesh building: vertices and faces computed in Python, then handed to
Blender ONCE. Imported by blender_scene.py - runs under Blender's bundled Python.

WHY THIS MODULE LOOKS LIKE ARITHMETIC AND NOT LIKE BLENDER. Every helper here used to build its
mesh through the operator layer - `bpy.ops.object.mode_set(mode="EDIT")`, `bpy.ops.mesh.select_all`,
`bpy.ops.mesh.extrude_region_move`, back to OBJECT - and then `apply_planar_uv` did a SECOND
identical round trip for `bpy.ops.uv.cube_project`. Two edit-mode entries per polygon, and each one
bracketed by `bpy.ops.object.select_all(action="DESELECT")`.

That is three separate costs, and they compound:

  * `select_all(DESELECT)` walks EVERY object in the scene. Called about twice per object created,
    against a scene that is still growing, so building N objects costs O(N^2) - about 800,000 object
    visits for the ~900 pieces a wide render carries.
  * every `bpy.ops` call pushes a global undo snapshot and forces a depsgraph re-evaluation. ~4,000
    operator invocations for one render, each costing milliseconds regardless of how small the mesh
    is. A 4-vertex marking paid the same overhead as a building.
  * a mode switch tears down and rebuilds the object's BMesh.

None of it buys anything. A prism off a ring is closed-form: the ring at z_base, the same ring at
z_base + height, quad walls between them, a cap at each end. A planar UV is `x / tile, y / tile`.
Both are a few lines of arithmetic, and Blender only needs to hear about the result.

THE SAME LESSON THIS REPO ALREADY LEARNED IN 2D. src/render/plan_view.py:_draw groups same-styled
geometry into ONE matplotlib collection because per-collection cost grows with how many are already
on the axes: measured at 2.44 s against 0.016 s for the same geometry, 156x. `MeshBatch` below is
that argument applied to Blender - one mesh per material instead of one per piece, which takes a
wide render's object count from ~900 to about a dozen.

    `first_index` is what makes this batchable: the faces come back numbered from that offset, so a
    caller accumulating many prisms into one mesh passes the running vertex count and concatenates.

    A zero `height` gives the flat cap alone, which is what almost every marking is - paint has no
    thickness worth modelling, and the pieces that do (kerbs, refuge islands) pass a real height.

    Winding is preserved from the ring, and the top cap is reversed so both caps face outward. That
    matters under flat shading with backface culling off: a cap wound the wrong way reads as a hole.

    than with how many triangles those objects contain. A wide render's ~900 markings are perhaps
    12,000 triangles between them, which is nothing; as 900 separate objects they are the whole cost
