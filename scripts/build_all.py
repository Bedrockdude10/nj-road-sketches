"""Build everything - all sites, all scenarios - with one command.

Rebuilding by hand meant ~30 separate `python scripts/phaseN_*.py` runs, each waited on in
turn. Measured, almost none of that time is this project's geometry; it's matplotlib building
and rasterizing the plan views, and Blender. Both parallelise cleanly, because sites share
nothing but a read-only cache, so this runs `--jobs` of them at once - defaulting to the
house cap in scripts/jobs.py, because this machine's other job costs 11 GB. Blender dominates
a `--render-3d` run: ~17 s for the first scene in a process and ~5 s for each one after.

    python scripts/build_all.py                     # 2D for every site and scenario
    python scripts/build_all.py --render-3d         # ...and the Blender renders too
    python scripts/build_all.py --dpi 90            # faster pictures while iterating
    python scripts/build_all.py --refresh-osm       # re-pull OSM after tracing in the editor
    python scripts/build_all.py --site columbia_princeton --render-3d

It writes exactly the files the phase scripts write (phase2_geometry_plot.png,
phase3_before_after_*.png, geometry_*.json, phase4_render_*.png), so it replaces running
them one by one rather than producing a second set of artifacts to keep in sync.

OSM STALENESS. The Overpass cache in output/.cache is keyed by (centre, radius) and never
expires, so a kerb, crossing or tactile-paving pad traced in OSM this morning is invisible
to the build until the cache is re-pulled. That is the project's worst failure mode -
ground truth present, but never reaching the render - so every site prints how old the
layers it read are, and `--refresh-osm` re-pulls them from Overpass (one round trip per
layer per site, not per scenario). Refresh is ignored under ROAD_SKETCHES_OFFLINE, which is how
the test suite stays hermetic.

Scene invariants (src/checks.py) run on every scenario. A failure is reported per scenario
and the build carries on, so one bad junction doesn't hide the state of the other three;
the exit status is non-zero if anything failed.
