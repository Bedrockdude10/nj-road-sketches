"""Prove a commit changed only prose - comments and docstrings - and no code.

WHY THIS EXISTS. Cutting prose across 23,742 lines of src/ is safe in principle: this repo
enables no doctests, ruff selects no pydocstyle rules, and no test asserts on docstring text.
But "in principle" is not a thing several agents editing in parallel can rely on, and the
2-minute suite is too slow to run after every paragraph. So this compares the CODE of two
revisions directly: it parses both, strips every docstring, discards comments (the tokenizer
never emits them into the AST), and dumps the normalised tree. Identical dumps mean the only
thing that changed was prose, whatever the diff looks like.

    scripts/check_prose_only.py                # working tree vs HEAD
    scripts/check_prose_only.py --base main    # working tree vs where this branch left main

--base RESOLVES THROUGH THE MERGE BASE. `--base main` compares against the commit this
branch forked from, not main's current tip, so commits someone else landed on main after the
fork are not reported as this branch's code changes. For the default HEAD the merge base IS
HEAD, so plain uncommitted-vs-HEAD is unchanged.

EXIT 0 means prose-only: no behaviour can have changed, and a full test run is not required
to establish that. EXIT 1 names the files whose code moved, and those DO need the suite.

THE ONE EXCEPTION IT REPORTS SEPARATELY. Five scripts pass their module docstring to argparse
or print it as help (build_all, corridor_render, corridor_report, export_all_scenarios,
diff_exports), so for those the docstring IS user-facing output rather than commentary.
corridor_report.py reads `__doc__.splitlines()[0]` and so depends on its FIRST LINE. Edits
there are flagged as needing a `--help` eyeball, because no AST check can see that.
