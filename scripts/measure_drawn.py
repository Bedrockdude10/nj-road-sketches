--all adds the other five questions SKILLS.md 0a says answer most complaints, so that answering
one never means writing a throwaway script or cropping a render:

    --section     what each treatment THINKS it placed, beside the room the traced kerb gives
    --limiters    all four things that decide where kerbside paint starts, not the first one
    --gaps        kerb offset minus outermost drawn offset, station by station
    --lanes       how wide the drawn travel lane is - drawn stripe to innermost drawn marking
    --continuity  whether a facility is one piece, and how wide the holes are

Two of those exist to print a number that CANNOT BE RECONSTRUCTED from the constants you think
went into it. --section reads offsets_from_centerline_ft off the resolved treatment, because a
two-way section is measured from a centreline shifted toward the far kerb and rebuilding it from
TARGET_LANE_WIDTH_FT gives an answer that is wrong and confident. It also flags the case where
demand and room agree to the last decimal: that is one figure, not two - the section was sized to
fill the room - so a comparison between them can never fail and proves nothing.

Every serious bug in this repo has been two derivations of one number agreeing with each other
and not with the picture: "every travel lane is exactly 11.00 ft" computed from the section,
while the drawn centreline sat 2.84 ft away. So the rule is measure the drawn output, not the
arithmetic that was supposed to produce it - and the rule got skipped because invoking it meant
recalling how to build a scenario and which frame to project into. This is that, as one command.

It reads the same PaintPiece list the 3D export serialises, and reports each piece as
(station, offset) in its leg's frame via station_offset_many: station runs out along the leg
from the junction centre, offset is signed across it. Feet throughout.

A piece with no leg (the corner treatments, which belong to neither of the two legs they sit
between) is reported against the junction centre instead, as a plain distance.

    "Every travel lane is exactly 11.00 ft" is this repo's canonical wrong answer: it was
    computed from the section while the drawn centreline sat 2.84 ft off the alignment, so one
    lane was 8.16 ft. Both bounds here are therefore read off the drawing.

    THE INNER BOUND IS THE STRIPE THE VIEWS ACTUALLY PAINT, through the same
    centerline_paint_ft call src/render/export.py and the plan view make, shift and all. Neither
    the alignment (the bug above) nor divider_shift_toward_ft, which would be the second
    derivation of one number that every serious defect here has turned out to be. A leg drawn
    with no centre stripe has no drawn inner bound at all: the row says `stripe=none` and
    measures from the alignment, because an undivided road has no lane to measure, only a
    half-road.

    THE OUTER BOUND IS THE INNERMOST LONGITUDINAL MARKING, or the traced kerb where there is
    none - and the `by` column names which, because the two answers mean opposite things. A lane
    held in by paint is this design's decision. A lane held in by the kerb is the street being
    narrow, which W Broad's north-east approach is: 7.2 ft from the alignment to its right kerb,
    and no 11 ft lane there to protect.

    From the divider's axis out to the bounding paint's INNER FACE - see _longitudinal_on for
    why the face and not the axis. That makes the figure directly comparable with
    TARGET_LANE_WIDTH_FT and with what checks.PaintClearOfTheTravelLane enforces. The asphalt a
    driver gets is narrower still by half the centre stripe, which is a constant across every
    leg here and so not what any of these rows are about.
