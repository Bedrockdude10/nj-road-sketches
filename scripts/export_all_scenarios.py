"""Export every site's every scenario to JSON, for diffing a refactor against itself.

`scripts/build_all.py --render-3d` writes these files too, but it also pays for Blender -
~17 s for the first scene in a process and ~5 s for each one after it, so ~1-2 minutes for
every site's every scenario. This does only the part that is this project's own code, and it
is the right part: export_scenario resolves the scene, builds the paint, builds the props and
asserts every invariant, so a change that moves any marking, any prop or any note shows up
here.

    python scripts/export_all_scenarios.py /tmp/before
    ... make a change ...
    python scripts/export_all_scenarios.py /tmp/after
    python scripts/diff_exports.py /tmp/before /tmp/after

Offline and against the committed OSM fixture, so it is reproducible:

    ROAD_SKETCHES_OFFLINE=1 ROAD_SKETCHES_OSM_CACHE=tests/fixtures/osm_cache PYTHONPATH=. \\
        .venv/bin/python scripts/export_all_scenarios.py /tmp/before

A site or scenario that will not export is reported by name at the end and the run carries
on, so one bad junction doesn't cost you the comparison for all the others; the exit status
is non-zero if anything failed. Note that diff_exports then compares two possibly-partial
trees - a scenario missing from BOTH sides is a scenario the diff cannot speak for.

    Returns (written, failures). NOTHING RAISES OUT OF HERE. This script's whole job is a
    before/after comparison across every site at once, so an exception that escapes costs
    the reader the sites that were fine as well as the one that broke - and it writes
    nothing usable, which is worse than reporting the bad site by name. Found with the
    NJ 31 & W Delaware junction, whose pavement ring does not close: one raise inside
    build_pavement_polygon and all six sites' exports were lost.

    Two boundaries, matching scripts/build_all.py:

    - PER SITE, around loading the model, its OSM context and its scenarios.py. This work
      is shared by every scenario, so if it fails the site has no exports to attempt and
      one line says so.
    - PER SCENARIO, around running the treatment and exporting it. Scenarios are
      independent - each starts from a fresh DesignState.from_model - so a proposal whose
      geometry the corner model cannot represent must not cost this site its baseline and
      its other proposals, which are exactly what you need in order to see whether the
      refactor moved anything.
