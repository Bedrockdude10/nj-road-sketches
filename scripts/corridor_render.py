"""A STRIP PLAN of one corridor: the whole street, straightened, on stacked panels.

    .venv/bin/python scripts/corridor_render.py --road "Broad Street"
    .venv/bin/python scripts/corridor_render.py --road "Princeton Avenue"

WHICH DESIGN IS DRAWN IS THE STREET'S DECISION, NOT THIS SCRIPT'S - `route_decision_for` on the
corridor's name. A street with a CorridorFacility gets the facility sheet: the lane, its buffer,
the far kerb's parking, and the which-kerb-carries-it table. A street with a CorridorCalming gets
the calming sheet: both travel lanes at target, every recovered foot marked or hatched, and the
refusal that decided against a facility printed on the drawing. A street this project has decided
nothing about gets the second sheet with nothing claimed as a proposal.

WHY STRAIGHTENED. Broad St through the borough is 3,693 ft long and about 47 ft wide - a 78:1
aspect. Drawn in world coordinates on one sheet the carriageway is a hairline; drawn at a
readable width it is eight feet of paper. So it is plotted in the corridor's OWN frame, station
along the page and offset across it, and cut into panels with match stations - which is how every
roadway plan set has drawn a corridor for a century, and for this reason.

What that costs, stated because a drawing may not quietly mislead: the street's curvature is
removed. Broad St bends, and on these panels it does not. Every LENGTH, WIDTH and OFFSET is true -
they are measured in the frame the drawing is plotted in - and the plan geometry is not. For the
shape of a junction, read the per-junction plan views; this drawing is for what runs BETWEEN them,
which is the thing no other drawing here shows.

    where the sheet is read. Stacking below whatever height the caller reports - the decision

    It was printed to a terminal, which is no use to anyone in a council chamber holding the
    sheet: the picture shows one kerb's proposal and the reason for choosing it lived somewhere
    the reader cannot see.

    WHAT MADE THE TEXT VERSION UNREADABLE was that it was laid out like a table of results using
    manually padded strings - a monospace font faking the grid a real table draws for free, with
    the winner marked by a trailing "<- fewest on the X" that hung off whichever cell happened to
    be widest and did nothing to draw the reader's eye to the actual number. A `matplotlib.table`
    fixes both: the grid lines up because the axes draws it, and the winning cell in each row that
    has one is shaded instead of footnoted.

    Every row's parking figure belongs to the OTHER kerb - the lane and the parking are never on
    the same side - so the header names each column "lane on the X kerb" rather than "the X kerb"
    to keep that from being misread as that kerb's own parking.

    AND IT ENDS ON THE COST, NOT ON THE REMAINDER. "45 stalls kept" is the number a reader is
    being asked to weigh a bikeway against, and on its own it is unreadable: nobody in a council
    chamber knows whether the corridor holds 50 or 500. `baseline_stalls` is the same walk with no
    facility on either kerb, so the subtraction below is a real one - which is the whole reason it
    is done here rather than left to be done wrongly against the corridor report's 243.

    Returns the height, in inches, this box occupies below the figure's own canvas - so `_legend`
    can be told exactly where the free space starts instead of guessing a fraction that a longer
    table quietly outgrows.
