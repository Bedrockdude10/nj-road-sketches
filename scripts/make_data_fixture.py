"""Clip data/ down to the few features the sites actually read, as a committed test fixture.

    .venv/bin/python scripts/make_data_fixture.py            # rebuild tests/fixtures/data
    .venv/bin/python scripts/make_data_fixture.py --pad-ft 3000 --out /tmp/clip

WHY. data/ is a 391 MB third-party download kept out of git, so every test that builds a real
junction - 333 of 707, including every geometry golden - skips in CI and in any checkout without
it. But a site reads 9 road segments out of NJDOT's 105,838 and the parcels within a few hundred
feet: the union of all six sites, padded a quarter-mile, is under a megabyte. tests/fixtures/
osm_cache already established the pattern for Overpass; this is the same trick for the two
GIS layers and the tax list.

THE CLIP IS READ THROUGH THE PRODUCTION LOADERS. ROAD_SKETCHES_DATA_DIR re-roots `data/...` paths
(src/sources/data_loader.resolve_data_path) and nothing else changes: same pandera schemas, same
CRS checks, same indexed-sibling swap. A separate "test data" code path would be a second datum
for the same fact, which is the most expensive defect class this repo has.

TWO THINGS KEEP IT HONEST, because a clip's failure mode is a read that SUCCEEDS with fewer
features - a wrong measurement that looks right:

  * Every layer written here is read back and compared to the same bbox read of the source,
    attribute by attribute and geometry WKB by WKB (verify_identical, borrowed from
    convert_road_network.py). A clip that is not a byte-faithful subset is deleted, not kept.
  * FIXTURE.json records how far the clip reaches, and load_road_network/load_parcels raise
    FixtureExtentExceeded on a read that runs off the edge of it (or on an unbounded read).
    Note the read bbox comes from each site's `clip_radius_m`, NOT from ROAD_SKETCHES_FRAME_SCALE -
    the frame scales leg lengths and the OSM context radius, not these two GIS reads - so
    editing clip_radius_m or adding a site is what makes the guard fire.

tests/test_data_fixture.py closes the loop from the other side: it builds every site from the
clip AND from the real data/ and compares the resolved models. That test needs the download, so
it runs locally and skips in CI - the guard above is the part that works where data/ is absent.
