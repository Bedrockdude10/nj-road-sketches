# Working in this repo without reinventing it

Read this before changing geometry, adding a marking, or "fixing" a number. It is not a summary
of README.md — it is the list of things an agent in this repo gets wrong, written from the ones
that actually happened, with the place each answer already lives.

README.md explains how the pipeline works. STANDARDS.md records every published figure and
whether it has been checked. **This file is about the failure modes**, because knowing the
architecture did not stop any of the mistakes below.

---

## 0. The one rule that would have prevented most of this

**Measure the drawn output, not the arithmetic that was supposed to produce it.**

Every serious bug in this repo's history has the same shape: two derivations of one fact, in
agreement with each other and not with the picture. In one session:

| what I checked | what was true |
|---|---|
| "every travel lane is exactly 11.00 ft" — computed from the section | the drawn centreline was 2.84 ft away, so a lane was 8.16 ft |
| flex posts sit in the buffer — computed from the declared cross-section | 30 posts were drawn inside the bike lane |
| "34.40 ft between kerbs at its narrowest" — the least `near + far` over the leg | the section is a constant off the least `near`, so the travel way got 32.01 ft and one lane 7.93 ft — see `governing_half_widths_ft` |
| the label says 9.6 ft so the geometry is wrong | the geometry was right; the *label* used the wrong datum |

So: after any change to geometry, **build the thing and measure the drawn coordinates** —
`station_offset_many(leg.centerline, np.asarray(drawn.coords))` — and open the PNG. A check that
reads the same function the renderer reads is not a check.

### 0a. Diagnose from the quantitative layer, not from the picture

The PNG is where you NOTICE a problem. It is never where you diagnose one. Everything this project
draws exists first as numbers — the resolved `DesignState`, the `PaintPiece` list, the traced kerb,
`output/*/geometry_*.json` — and that is the layer the whole design is kept in so a defect can be
*measured* instead of guessed at.

Cropping and squinting at renders cost most of one session and produced **three wrong diagnoses in
a row** on a single complaint ("the bike lane doesn't reach the kerb on W Broad"):

| guessed from the picture | what the numbers said |
|---|---|
| the hatch spills over the kerb | it reaches the kerb exactly; the kerb wanders 3 ft |
| the wrong channel removed the hatching | both channels hatch; only the colour changed |
| the unbuffered rung skips the kerbside zone | the zone is built and added, on the *other* leg |
| — | the two lanes' green is **80.3 ft apart** and the extension between them has **0.0 sq ft** of surface: dotted lines only |

Only the last line is the defect, and it took one query to find once the question was asked of the
data. The reader also cannot tell you which leg they mean from a render, and neither can you: two of
those wrong answers were about `w_broad_st_northeast` when the complaint was about
`w_broad_st_southwest`.

**So: before proposing a cause, print the numbers.** All of them are one command:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/measure_drawn.py <site> --scenario <build_*> --leg <leg> --all
```

| what it prints | the question it answers | reads |
|---|---|---|
| the paint table | what is drawn on this leg-side, stationed in its own frame | `station_offset_many` |
| `--section` | what the treatment THINKS it placed, against the room the kerb gives | `section(state).offsets_from_centerline_ft()`, `narrowest_half_width_ft` |
| `--limiters` | all four things deciding where kerbside paint starts | see the table below |
| `--gaps` | kerb offset minus outermost drawn offset, station by station | `surface_reach_at`, `curb_offsets_at_stations` |
| `--lanes` | how wide the DRAWN travel lane is, and whether paint or the kerb holds it in | `centerline_paint_ft`, `curb_offsets_at_stations` |
| `--continuity` | whether a facility is one piece, and how wide the holes are | `unary_union` |

Reach for the flag before the render. Each one exists because a session guessed that answer from
a picture and got it wrong, and each is cheap enough that there is no reason to guess.

**AND NEVER REBUILD A SECTION'S ARITHMETIC FROM THE CONSTANTS YOU THINK IT USED.** The third query
above exists because that reconstruction is always wrong here. A two-way section is measured from a
centreline that has been SHIFTED toward the far kerb, so the near-side travel edge is 3.8–6.5 ft on
Broad St and not `TARGET_LANE_WIDTH_FT`; assuming the 11 ft produced a confident "a protected lane
needs 22.0 ft and the kerb gives 20.32, so it does not fit", and a four-option design decision put
to Danny on the strength of it. Nothing about it was true.

**AND A SECTION IS A RIGID PIECE, SO ONE PROFILE HAS TO PLACE ALL OF IT.** `corridor_paint`
computed the buffer's inner edge from the traced kerb station by station, while `far_kerb_lane_edge`
— which hangs the travel-lane divider off that same edge — read one scalar per run out of the run's
governing cross-section. Two derivations of one line, in agreement with each other nowhere: on the
1,050 ft run through station 1400 they ended **7.3 ft apart**, the drawn near travel lane measured
**11.00 to 22.31 ft** against a design of 11.00, and the far kerb's parking was counted against a
stripe that was not where the stripe was. Neither number was wrong on its own terms. The fix was one
placement line (`place = taper_limited(stations, offs)`) that every offset comes off, and the divider
derived from the drawn edge rather than from the scalar — after which both travel lanes are
`divided_lane_width_ft` at every station by construction, the surplus lands on the far kerb, and the
far kerb goes from 40 markable stalls to 72. **The tell was that all three of `_build_run`'s edge
lines varied by 11.31 ft while the thing derived from them varied by 0.00.** A number that cannot
move, downstream of one that does, is the shape of this bug.

`--section` prints that comparison and flags it when it holds, which is the only useful thing to
do with a check that cannot fail. The tell is worth learning as a shape: printing demand against
room gave
**identity on all six corridor legs** — 14.71/14.71, 20.32/20.32, 26.29/26.29. Two figures that
agree to the last decimal in every case are not a confirmation, **they are one figure**: the
section is sized to fill the room at the leg's narrowest point, so it fits there by construction and
the comparison can never fail. When a check cannot fail, the thing it was going to prove is not a
finding — go and find which span, which datum, or which frame differs instead. (That identity is
also what wrecked the since-deleted `section_holds_to_ft`, a guard that walked out from station 0
looking for the first station where the kerb came inside the section and ended the facility there.
The first such station IS the narrowest point the section was sized on, so it cut a lane to a 6 ft
stub. A search whose answer is fixed by construction is the same mistake as a check that cannot
fail.)

A gap profile — kerb offset minus outermost drawn offset, station by station — turns "it looks
janky" into "bare from station 0 to 63.7, then 1.4 ft widening to 2.6 ft by station 118", which
names the mechanism on its own. That is `--gaps`; extend it rather than writing another throwaway
script, and NEVER answer a geometry question by cropping a PNG. Note it is **binned**, so that a
transverse marking no cut lands on is still seen, and that an empty bin has to read as *no
measurement*. Written the obvious way with `np.max(..., initial=np.nan)` the initial value folds
into the reduction, every bin comes out NaN, every comparison against a threshold comes out
false, and the profile reports "flush the whole way" having measured nothing. **A quantitative
check that cannot see anything must say so, not pass.**

**AND MEASURE THE PAINT'S SURFACE, NOT ITS NEAREST VERTEX — THIS TOOL GOT THAT WRONG FOR ITS
WHOLE LIFE.** The line this paragraph used to carry ("the outermost vertex in each bin is what
'how far out does the paint reach here' can mean") is false, and it is false in a way that made
`--gaps` answer the one complaint it exists for with a defect that was not there. A fill is
offset from the traced kerb, so its outer edge carries the kerb's vertices AND NOTHING BETWEEN
THEM — 9 over the 85 ft of `greenwood_ave_south` left, against 44 on its inner edge, which is a
plain offset from the alignment. Every 10 ft bin past station 54.5 therefore held inner vertices
and no outer one, `max` returned the inner edge at a fixed 11.82 ft, and the profile reported
kerb-minus-11.82: **4.06 ft of separation at station 120 on paint flush to 0.00**, and up to
**17.54 ft on `broad_st_west`**. A perpendicular cut through the drawn polygon cannot read the
wrong edge, because it does not choose between edges — `surface_reach_at`, kept as the max with
the vertex reduction because each is a lower bound on the reach and the largest is the best
estimate, which can only close a reported gap and never open one. Asked why the kerb was
separating from the hatching on Greenwood, the honest answer was **it is not, to 0.04 ft** —
everything the tool had been reporting along that leg was its own arithmetic. **A check that
cries wolf is retired as fast as one that cannot fail, and it costs more on the way out.**

**AND WHEN A MARKING DOES NOT REACH, PRINT EVERY LIMITER, NOT THE FIRST ONE.** Four separate
things decide where a kerbside marking starts, they disagree, and the answer is whichever sits
furthest out — so measuring one, finding it innocent, and moving on proves nothing. `--limiters`
prints all four side by side with the binding one named, and a `paint@` column to check it
against — but narrow it with `--kind` first, because these hold KERBSIDE paint back and
unfiltered the column reports whichever marking merely happens to start earliest:

| limiter | where it lives |
|---|---|
| the corner return | `leg_clearance_ft` |
| this junction's mouth | `junction_mouths_ft`, with `corner_tangent_station_ft` as its fallback |
| the crossing band | `crosswalk_reach_on_leg_side_ft` — the **BAND**, never `crosswalk_offsets[leg].offset_ft`, which is the crossing's CENTRE and reads 32.3 where the skewed band reaches 53.8 |
| whether the kerb is traced there | `curb_station_span` — every kerb at all five sites starts 12–58 ft out, because OSM traces the block and not the corner |

One session found each of those binding on a different leg of ONE junction, and reported a 21.5 ft
defect that did not exist by measuring the third one wrong. The tell that you have the right
limiter is arithmetic identity: `paint@` equalling `clearance_ft` to two decimals on five
leg-sides at four sites is a mechanism, and "roughly similar" is a coincidence.

Note also that a length derived from the corner fillet **diverges as a corner sharpens** —
a tangent point sits `R/tan(θ/2)` back, so 1.0 R at a square junction and 2.5 R at a 44° Y. That
is §0b's lesson in a second disguise: the quantity is local, but it is not the quantity you meant.

### 0b. MEASURE AT THE FRAME THE READER IS LOOKING AT — legs are longer on a wide sheet

`--frame-scale` does not just crop wider. It scales `leg_lengths`, so a 130 ft leg is 325 ft on a
2.5× sheet and every function that measures "over the leg" gets a different answer. Measuring the 1×
build while the reader is looking at a 2.5× sheet reports a defect fixed that is not:

```bash
.venv/bin/python scripts/measure_drawn.py wbroad_louellen --scenario ... --frame-scale 2.5
```

Worse than a measuring mistake, it is a *design* mistake waiting to happen. A rule sized off a
TOTAL over the leg — total kerb swing, total anything — silently becomes a function of the render
frame, so the drawing changes when you widen the picture. The bikeway followed its kerb at 1× and
stood 8.4 ft clear of it at 2.5×, from one `<= 6.0 ft` threshold. **Anything compared against a
threshold has to be a rate, a curvature, or something else local**; if it is an amount accumulated
over a leg, the leg's length is an input and the leg's length is a rendering decision. `git grep`
for a new constant's units before you add it.

**A MINIMUM OVER A LEG MOVES WITH THE SHEET TOO, AND THAT IS ALLOWED. WHAT IS NOT ALLOWED IS
TRIMMING THE PAINT.** `narrowest_half_width_ft` takes the least half-width over the whole drawn leg,
so a longer leg reaches further and finds a narrower pinch: W Broad's southwest approach is 20.32 ft
at 1× and 16.58 ft at 2.5×, off a real pinch 318 ft out. The wide sheet therefore lands that leg on
a narrower rung. **This was fixed the wrong way first and the wrong fix is the instructive one.** The
first answer was a frozen design span — a `design_length_ft` the treatments measured over while the
render drew further — which bought frame-invariance and paid for it in the only currency that
matters: a section sized over 130 ft, DRAWN over 325 ft, and then *trimmed off* at the first station
it stopped fitting. `broad_st_east` carried green over 180 ft of a 425 ft leg under 42 flex posts and
a centre stripe that both ran the full length. Roads are a network and these treatments apply
universally, so **a treatment applies to all of the street in the drawing** — the rung gives, the
extent never does.

So the test is not "is this a rate". It is **"if this answer moves with the sheet, is the thing that
moves a WIDTH or an EXTENT?"** A width that steps down on a sheet showing a tighter pinch is the
design working. An extent, a count, or a claim of protection that moves is a bug — hence
`BikewayReachesTheEndOfItsKerb` (`src/checks.py`), fatal, and every rung of
`BROAD_ST_TWO_WAY_BIKEWAY` keeping the full buffer.

**And know the residual: a width that moves can take a treatment with it.** `broad_st_east` measures
43.26 ft between kerbs over 170 ft and 39.16 ft over the 425 ft actually drawn, which drops the
far-kerb spare from 7.44 ft to 3.34 ft — under `MIN_USABLE_STALL_FT` — so that leg is *parked* on
the narrow sheet and *hatched* on the wide one. Nothing is wrong with either drawing; the pinch is
real. But the section is sized on the narrowest point anywhere along the leg, so one tight spot 300
ft out sets the width for all 425 ft, and a treatment two derivations downstream flips. Print
`state.notes` after any change to a section, not just the paint.

Note also which fixture is which, because it is the opposite of what you would guess:
`tests/conftest.py` has **`site_models` at 1×** and **`wide_site_models` at `WIDE_FRAME_SCALE =
2.5`**, and the geometry goldens (`digests`, `test_geometry_regression.py`) build from the **1×** one
— so the goldens cannot see anything the wide sheet does. The parking flip above moves nothing in
any golden. **The goldens are the 1× half; the INVARIANTS are swept at both** —
`test_every_scenario_satisfies_the_invariants` on `site_models` and
`..._on_the_wide_sheet` on `wide_site_models`, which is the render's own frame. That second one
exists because at 1× the sweep reported nothing on any site while 2.5× reported a fatal
`markings_collide` that refused a shipped render's 3D export. A green golden still says nothing
about a number in `output/`; that is what `--frame-scale` on `measure_drawn.py` is for.

## 1. Before you write a number, look for it

There is exactly one home for each of these. Adding a second copy is the most common defect here.

| you need | it already exists as | in |
|---|---|---|
| travel lane target width | `TARGET_LANE_WIDTH_FT` | `src/geometry/treatments/` |
| a CRS string | `WGS84`, `NJ_STATE_PLANE_FT` | `src/geometry/model/` |
| how far the divider sits off the alignment | `divider_shift_toward_ft(state, leg, side)` | `src/geometry/treatments/` |
| a travel lane's real width | `travel_lane_width_ft(state, leg, side, painted_ft)` | `src/geometry/treatments/` |
| hold a lane at target, spend the surplus | `hold_travel_lane_at_target(state, leg, side)` | `src/geometry/treatments/` |
| may this kerb hold parking? | `kerb_may_hold_parking(state, leg, side)` | `src/geometry/treatments/` |
| which side of a leg faces north/south | `side_facing(leg, "south")` | `src/geometry/model/` |
| room beside a lane, measured on the traced kerb | `narrowest_half_width_ft`, `kerbside_allowance_ft` | `src/geometry/model/`, `treatments.py` |
| the centreline stripes both views draw | `centerline_paint_ft` | `src/render/crosswalks.py` |
| a band between two lateral offsets | `offset_band_polygon` | `src/geometry/model/` |
| a line N ft to one side | `inset_line_ft` — **never** `offset_curve` for stationed work | `src/geometry/model/` |
| a profile rate-limited to a taper | `taper_limited` | `src/geometry/model/` |
| which legs of a junction are on a route | `legs_on_road(model, road)` — **never** a per-site leg tuple | `src/geometry/treatments/` |
| what is proposed along a named street | `route_decision_for(road)` — **never** `import BROAD_ST_TWO_WAY_BIKEWAY` | `src/geometry/treatments/` |

**Search before writing.** `grep -rn "SOME_CONSTANT" src/` costs nothing. Writing the second copy
costs a session: the far-kerb rule was written inline in one site's `scenarios.py`, the sibling
site never got it, and two legs shipped with 11.68 ft and 13.21 ft lanes.

---

## 2. The two datums, which are 25 ft apart

This has caused three separate bugs. Learn it once.

- **WHETHER there is room** is a measurement of the **traced kerb** —
  `narrowest_half_width_ft(leg, side)`.
- **WHERE the paint goes** is an offset from the **nominal half-width** (`leg.curb_to_curb_ft/2`),
  because that is the datum `MarkedParking` and `LaneNarrowing` subtract their own widths from.

On `broad_st_east` those differ by 25 ft (config says 68.0; the traced kerbs are 43.26 apart).
Size paint off the traced number and you draw a 20 ft hatch. `apply_osm_parking` spells this out
in a comment; read it rather than rediscovering it.

**The third instance is a corridor's two-way section**, and it is the one that shows what the rule
costs when it is broken quietly: `_build_run` measured the section from the kerb and
`far_kerb_lane_edge` measured the divider from the alignment, 7.3 ft apart, and no check could see it
because each side was internally consistent. See §0a. The resolution there was not to pick a datum
but to make the section rigid — one placement line, every offset off it — which is what a
cross-section is.

---

## 3. Adding a marking touches six places, and the seventh is the golden

README.md has the six-place table. Two additions to it:

1. **The channel decides the colour.** `blender_scene.py` draws every edge-line channel in the
   white `marking_mat` and only the centreline channel in yellow. A yellow marking routed through
   an edge-line channel renders white in 3D and yellow in 2D, with nothing to catch it.
2. **`POLYLINE_CHANNELS` in `tests/test_geometry_regression.py` is derived from
   `markings.CHANNELS`** — so a new channel gets a golden automatically. It was a hardcoded list
   and it drifted immediately: a marking with 30 segments, drawn in both views, had no golden.

**Pin extent, not just position.** The digest pinned `stop_bar_centre_m` and `stop_bar_axis` but
not the span, so moving where the bar starts changed nothing in any golden. Same hole existed for
the crosswalk reach and for `centerline_paint_m`. If you add a marking, pin where it is *and how
far it goes*.

---

## 4. Invariants: re-express, never relax

When a check fires on a design you believe is correct, the check is usually right about the
property and wrong about the frame. Fix the frame.

`PaintClearOfTheTravelLane` measured the lane from the alignment, which only holds while the two
travel lanes straddle it. The two-way lane breaks that. The fix was to read the shifted lane edge
off the design — **not** to exempt those legs, which would have dropped the check on the design
most likely to get the arithmetic wrong.

Also: **verify a new check fails first.** `git stash` the fix, watch it report, restore. A check
that has never fired pins nothing. Both new checks in this session were verified that way (18
violations before, 0 after).

And note which checks are **fatal** — most are, so they block the 3D export. A violation printed
by `phase3_treatments.py` still saved a picture; that does not mean it passed.

---

## 5. Where facts live, and what that decides

| it is… | it lives… |
|---|---|
| a fact about the street as it exists | on `IntersectionModel`, resolved once at load |
| a decision a proposal makes | a `Treatment` subclass, geometry as a *method* |
| a way of drawing something decided | a `PaintKind`, or a prop |
| a published figure | a row in **STANDARDS.md**, with its provenance tier |

**The last row is not optional and I skipped it.** Six standards constants went into code comments
from memory in one session — the exact failure STANDARDS.md's preamble describes. If you write a
number and cite NACTO/AASHTO/MUTCD for it, add the row in the same commit, and mark it *as cited*
unless you actually opened the document.

---

## 6. Data comes from somebody else, so validate at the boundary

`src/sources/schemas.py` holds a pandera schema per external layer, validated in
`load_road_network`, `load_parcels` and `assessor.py`. Two things to know:

- **A wrong CRS returns ZERO ROWS, not an error** — indistinguishable from "nothing mapped here".
  It cost two round trips in one session. Compare CRS by **horizontal identity**, never by string:
  `MercerCountyParcels.shp` is a compound CRS whose WKT matches no EPSG code.
- **`strict=False` is deliberate** for the column *set* (third-party files add columns), but the
  columns we read are a contract — not-null where the real file is never null, with a domain.
  `nullable=True` everywhere is not a lax contract, it is the absence of one.

---

## 7. OSM is partial, and partial in a specific way

- **A restriction over PART of a kerb does not close it.** OSM splits the way. `broad_st_east` is
  `no_parking` for its first 79.6 ft and explicitly `restriction=none` for the 90.4 ft beyond;
  reading any prohibiting span as closing the kerb hatched 90 ft of legal parking. Use
  `kerb_may_hold_parking`.
- **Driveway coverage is ~29%** of parcels fronting Broad St. State the coverage fraction beside
  any count. Parcel frontage is *not* a proxy — plenty of lots have no driveway.
- **A branch's side must be probed ~25 ft along it.** A driveway joins at a shared node *on* the
  centreline, so the northing there carries no side information and comes out as float noise.
- **The cache and the test fixture are separate.** `--refresh-osm` re-pulls
  `output/.cache/borough_*.json`; `tests/fixtures/osm_cache/` does not update itself.

---

## 8. The verification loop, in cost order

1. Write the test; **confirm it fails** against the pre-change code.
2. `scripts/export_all_scenarios.py /tmp/before` → change → `/tmp/after` → `scripts/diff_exports.py`.
3. `./scripts/test.sh` (includes lint, import contracts, goldens).
4. `scripts/build_all.py --render-3d`, **and open the PNGs**.
5. Measure the drawn geometry numerically (see §0).

A golden failure is not automatically a bug. Read the diff, confirm every moved number is one you
meant to move, then `--force-regen` and commit the goldens **in the same commit as the cause**.
