# Sites

Each subdirectory is one intersection/corridor study: a `config.yaml` and a
`scenarios.py`. `osm_areas.yaml` beside them is the list of TOWNS this project has an OSM
snapshot of - one download each, and a site is served from whichever area fully contains its
context window (`src/sources/osm_context.py`). A site in no area is refused rather than served
half its ground truth, so adding a municipality starts there. Nothing in `src/` or `scripts/` hardcodes anything about a
specific intersection - see the main README's "Adding a new site" section for
the step-by-step process. This file documents the `config.yaml` schema.

Use `sites/broad_st_greenwood/config.yaml` as a working example of every field below.

**This schema is enforced, not just documented.** `src/site_schema.py` states it as pydantic
models and `src/site.py:load_site_config` validates against them on every load, so a config
that disagrees with what follows fails immediately, naming the file and every problem in it at
once. That includes the two failures this prose could never prevent: a MISSPELLED KEY (which
otherwise reads downstream as "this fact was deliberately omitted") and a LEG NAME THAT MATCHES
NOTHING (which otherwise draws nothing and says nothing). If you add a field here, add it
there - an unrecognised key is an error.

## `scenarios.py`

Must expose:

```python
def build_demo_scenario(baseline: DesignState) -> DesignState:
    ...
```

Compose treatments from `src/geometry/treatments/` by applying them to a design:
`state.apply(RefugeIsland(LegTarget("broad_st_east"), offset_ft=40, width_ft=6))`. Each is a frozen
dataclass that validates itself, and `apply` checks its target exists at this junction - see
`sites/broad_st_greenwood/scenarios.py` for a worked example.
Nothing stops you from adding more functions to a site's `scenarios.py` for
alternative scenarios (e.g. `build_minimal_scenario`); phase3/phase4 scripts
only call `build_demo_scenario` by convention, not by hard requirement.
