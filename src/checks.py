"""Scene invariants: the things that must be true of every render, checked every time.

The failure mode guarded against is not a crash but a finished-looking render that asserts
something false about the street. Each invariant is checked on BOTH paths - the 2D plan view
and the 3D export - because the premise of the 2D reconstruction is that it shows what the 3D
render will show, and a check that only guards the export lets the two drift.

Two design choices worth stating:

  * ALL violations are collected before anything is raised, so a bad junction costs one
    edit-run cycle rather than one per violation.
  * A violation carries its coordinates. The plan view draws them, so the error message and
    the picture agree about where to look.

`check_scene` reports; `assert_scene_valid` raises. Phase scripts save the plot first and
assert after, so a failure always comes with a picture of itself.

    90 ft of a rural arterial with trucks, past all three, and what found it was being asked
    whether the lanes were 11 ft.

    ONLY THE KERB THE DIVIDER MOVED TOWARD, which is what makes this the design's doing and not
    the street's. Louellen Street is 19.3 ft between kerbs and no check widens it; what must not
    happen is a treatment taking one kerbside for a bikeway and pushing the opposing lane into a
    kerb that pinches at a station the section was never measured at. So the far side is checked
    and the near side is not: the near lane is bounded by the section's own inner edge, which is
    held on the alignment (place.py, lane_edge_line) and is already PaintClearOfTheTravelLane's.

    AGAINST THE DESIGN'S OWN LANE WIDTH, not TARGET_LANE_WIDTH_FT. Where a leg cannot hold two
    target-width lanes the design says so and splits the travel way, and divided_lane_width_ft
    is that declared figure; comparing against 11 ft would report the declaration as the defect.

    STATION BY STATION, because the failure is local and both inputs are whole-leg minima. The
    section is sized on the near kerb's narrowest point and the divider is one fixed offset, so
    the far lane is `far(s) - shift` and nothing about its minimum can be recovered from either
    kerb's reduction to a single number - which is how min(near + far) came to credit this leg
    with 2.44 ft that is drawn as bike-lane surplus on the OTHER kerb.

    AND IT FIRED TWICE, ON TWO DIFFERENT MECHANISMS, which is why the message names a stretch and
    not just a station. The second is the one worth remembering: a facility whose reach stops
    short still shifts the divider to the END of the leg, so a far minimum taken over the RUN has
    measured the wrong kerb. On a 3x w_broad_st_southwest that was 0.30 ft off a lane already at
    its floor, over the last 18 ft of 390 - invisible in a render, fatal all the same, and fixed
    in governing_half_widths_ft rather than here.

class BikewayReachesTheEndOfItsKerb(SceneCheck):
    """A bikeway is drawn along the whole kerb it was placed on.

    EXTENT IS A DESIGN CLAIM, and the path that used to trim it made no note. A kerbside facility
    was ended at the first station where the traced kerb stopped leaving room for its outermost
    stripe, on the argument that "how far down the block the drawing carries it is a fact about
    the frame". It is not: a render asserting a protected two-way bikeway over 42% of
    broad_st_east - with 42 flex posts and six lane symbols standing along the 245 ft that got no
    paint - is exactly the finished-looking-but-false picture this module exists to catch.

    WHAT MAKES IT A DEFECT rather than a fact about the street is that nothing had judged the
    street unable to hold the facility there. The section was sized over a span SHORTER than the
    one it was drawn over, so those 245 ft were never measured at all - see
    narrowest_half_width_ft, which measures the whole drawn leg now, and the rung ladder, which is
    where a street that genuinely cannot hold the wide section gets a NARROWER section rather than
    a shorter one.

    ANCHORED ON THE TRACED KERB - not the leg's length, and not the facility's own furniture. The
    kerb's traced span is a fact about the street AND the span paint_stations would have built
    over, so this compares what was drawn against what there was to draw on. The contraflow
    divider, the flex posts and the lane symbols each run the leg by a path of their own: all
    three covered the full 425 ft while the green stopped at 180, so a check measuring the
    facility against its own furniture would have called that flush.

    FAR END ONLY. The near end stops against the junction mouth or the crossing band and is meant
    to - that is curbside_paint_ft and the four limiters in SKILLS 0a, none of which are defects.

    AND A SPAN THE DESIGN REFUSED BY NAME IS NOT A SHORTFALL. "no note saying why" is the actual
    complaint in the message below, so the check has to be able to see a note - which is why a
    refusal is a record on the design (DesignState.facility_refusals) and not a line on stdout.
    A kerb whose facility stops at 361 ft with a FacilityRefusal covering 361-389 ft, carrying the
    measurement that stopped it, is a drawing that says what it is doing; the same kerb with no
    such record is the 245 ft of bare asphalt under 42 flex posts this check was written for.
    The subtraction is bounded BY the recorded span, so a refusal cannot excuse ground it does not
    cover: refuse 20 ft and stop 200 ft short and this still fires on the other 180.

    THE TOLERANCE IS THE DOTTED GRID, not slack for a design decision. Where the end of the kerb
    is inside an opening the lane crosses dotted, the last mark lands on paint_stations' ~2 ft
    grid and the surface finishes a step short of the kerb's own last station - 0.7 ft on
    e_broad_st_east, 1.7 ft on e_broad_st_west. Past BIKEWAY_SHORTFALL_TOLERANCE_FT a facility

    check reads the surface pieces that were drawn and asks how far up the kerb they got, so a
    leg-side with NO surface at all never enters its dictionary and is never tested. A facility
    that stops early is caught; a facility that was never placed is invisible to it. Both are
    the same defect - an approach of a corridor route with no facility on it - and the second is
    the worse one, because there is nothing on the drawing to notice.

    Measured at W Broad & Louellen on a 3x sheet, which is how it was found: `w_broad_st_northeast`
    took the constrained 8 + 3 rung and `w_broad_st_southwest` fell off the bottom of the ladder,
    so the render showed a protected bikeway arriving at the junction from one side and simply
    ending. Every invariant passed and the 3D export was written.

    WHY IT IS THE JUNCTION'S BUSINESS RATHER THAN THE LADDER'S. CorridorFacility already prints a
    NOTE when it refuses every rung, and a note is the right answer to "this street is too narrow
    here" - but it is not a drawing that can be shipped. THE LADDER ITSELF DECLARES THE INVARIANT
    AND CANNOT ENFORCE IT: BROAD_ST_TWO_WAY_BIKEWAY's own note ends "what may NOT move with the
    sheet is whether an approach is PROTECTED - every rung here keeps the full buffer, which is
    what makes that safe". That argument is what licenses the rung to move with the sheet at all,
    and it holds only while SOME rung fits. Falling off the bottom of the ladder is the case it
    does not cover, and it was prose with nothing reading it. STANDARDS.md 4 says the same thing
    from the other end: a width may move with the sheet, an extent or a claim of protection may
    not.

    THE COMPARISON IS BETWEEN SIBLINGS, not against a declared route, so this check knows nothing
    about Broad Street. Approaches of ONE street at ONE junction either all carry the facility or
    none do; a street with a single approach here has no sibling to disagree with and is skipped,

    THE ONE INTERSECTION THAT HAD NO RULE. Every other street these legs cross becomes a
    src/geometry/kerbs.py:KerbOpening and one table decides what each marking does at it; the
    junction the drawing is CENTRED on was handled by hand, with a mean-station test as the only
    thing keeping paint out of the corner. A mean station is not a side - on a crossing surveyed
    43.7 deg off square the offcut behind it runs diagonally and its mean lands past the
    crossing - so hatching was drawn inside the intersection. CrossingsAreNotPaintedOver does not
    cover this: this junction's CROSSINGS are cut out of everything by curbside_paint_ft, but the
    OFFCUT is not.

    THE MOUTH, NOT THE CROSSING, is what this measures against - see
    src/geometry/model/corners.py:junction_mouth_ft. The corner return's tangent point is where
    this kerb starts existing, so a marking drawn beside it before that point is drawn beside a
    corner. And it is ZERO on a kerb that runs straight through, which is why this check does not
    have to carve out MUTCD 11th ed. 3B.11(07)'s T-intersection exception: a through-running kerb
    has no mouth, so nothing on it can be inside one.

    ENTIRELY INSIDE, deliberately, so this has no false positives to argue about. A zone cut by a
    skewed crossing has a diagonal end whose stations reach back into the mouth while the zone
    itself sits outside; reporting the overlap would fire on every one of those. A piece whose
    every vertex is inside the mouth is not a zone with a long end - it is a marking in the
    intersection. That is the claim the picture makes, and it is the one worth failing on.

    RIMS ARE NOT MARKINGS IN THE INTERSECTION, they are the line that closes one AT its edge, so
    they are skipped rather than reported. A rim runs ACROSS the kerbside strip at the mouth's
    far end, and the mouth's far end is a station - so every vertex of it is inside by
    construction, always, however correct it is. What must not be inside the junction is the zone
    the rim closes, and that is what the loop below tests. This exemption is the reason the

    kerb - every driveway and side street - and reads the answer off the same table the cut was
    made from (markings.AT_AN_OPENING, via gives_way_at). Where a row is FILLETED or STOPPED
    nothing is laid back in, so the drawing owes the reader a GAP, and a piece running from one
    side of the entrance to the other is the absence of one.

    MEASURED AGAINST THE SURVEYED OPENING, NOT AGAINST THE GROUND THE CUT USED, and that is the
    only version of this check worth having. Written the obvious way - intersect each piece with
    openings.against(its kind), the very shape it was clipped by - it reported nothing on any
    site, because a piece clipped by a shape cannot overlap the shape. It could not fail, so it
    proved nothing (SKILLS.md 0a). The opening's own start and end stations come off
    kerbs.KerbOpening, which is OSM's survey of the street, so a wrong datum in the cut has
    nowhere to hide.

    WHY THIS NEEDED A CHECK AT ALL: what survives a wrong datum is a RIBBON, and a ribbon of
    hatching is invisible. `w_broad_st_northeast left` under build_proposal_two_way_bike_lane
    carried 0.10 ft of bike buffer through all three of its openings, because two derivations of
    "where the travel lane ends on this side" disagreed by 0.92 ft - the opening ground was built
    from divider_shift + TARGET_LANE_WIDTH_FT (3.81 ft) while the section had put the buffer's
    face at 3.71 ft, the near travel lane having come out at 10.08 ft rather than the target.
    Nobody would ever see a tenth of a foot of green. What they saw was PaintContext.rim
    faithfully outlining it: a 49.68 ft solid edge line straight across a 9.5 ft driveway, plus
    41.98 ft across the cross-street mouth and 30.69 ft across the next driveway. Fail on the
    remnant rather than on the line, because the remnant is the cause.

    BRIDGING, not overlapping, so there is no false positive to argue about - the same choice
    NoPaintInsideTheJunction made and for the same reason. A zone cut by a skewed crossing has a
    diagonal end whose stations reach into a mouth while the zone sits outside it; a piece with
    material inside the entrance AND on both sides of it is not a long end, it is a marking that
    never gave way. RIMS ARE SKIPPED: a rim is the line drawn AT the cut, so it lies against the
    opening by construction however correct it is.
