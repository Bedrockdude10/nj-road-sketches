    says about each (kerb=lowered, tactile_paving=yes, wheelchair=yes).

    THREE relevance tests, because "is this kerb ours" has three different answers and they are
    not interchangeable:

      * `radius_ft` - everything within that distance of the centre. The DRAWING test, and the
        only one of the three that is about the picture rather than about the junction. Use it
        for anything being rendered. IT IS NOT APPLIED TO A SUPPLIED `kerbs` - see below.
      * `legs` - _runs_along_a_leg: kerb anywhere along a leg, however far out, which is what a
        curb LINE wants. Traced ways well out along a leg fail the near test.
      * neither - the NEAR set, within KERB_NEAR_JUNCTION_FT of the junction CENTRE. The right
        test for fitting a corner RADIUS and for measuring a width: a return belonging to this
        junction is close to it, and at the fetch radius anything looser drags in the
        neighbouring junctions' returns.

    There is no default: a caller must say which question it is asking. A renderer taking the
    near set draws a cross of asphalt floating on grass, because a filter written to keep a
    neighbouring junction out of a CIRCLE FIT then decides what the drawing contains.

    The wide set is deliberately NOT fed to the fit - admitting those ways reshuffles the vertex
    contest at the acute, partly traced junction and leaves louellen_st_west with fewer usable
    kerbs: more data in, less data used. So the fit runs on the near set, and
    _extend_curbs_with_far_tracing rebuilds the curb lines from the wide set afterwards, once
    the widths are settled and extra ways can only lengthen a curb, never redefine one.
    See tests/test_leg_frame.py.

    A SUPPLIED `kerbs` IS ALREADY THE ANSWER TO THE DRAWING TEST, so `radius_ft` is not applied
    to one. A junction knows a centre and a radius, so it fetches a circle and re-clipping it to
    that same circle is free; a window onto the borough document hands over the ways it clipped
    to its own SQUARE, and a circle about the centre then deletes the corners of the very sheet
    being drawn - 20 of a 1,000 ft window's 67 kerb ways, one of them 72 ft long and 521 ft out,
    on a picture that reaches 707 ft to its corner. The `legs` and NEAR tests still apply to a
    supplied layer: those ask whether a kerb is THIS JUNCTION's, which is a different question
    from whether it is in the picture, and the window cannot have answered it.
