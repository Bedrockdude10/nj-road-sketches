"""FITTING THE LEGS TO THE TRACED KERBS - the heaviest thing this package does.

A leg starts as NJDOT's alignment plus a width from config.yaml, and neither is a survey. Where the
kerbs have been traced they are better evidence than both, so the leg is resized onto them, centred
between them, and joined tangentially to its through partner. Every step is bounded (MATERIAL_*,
MAX_*) so a bad trace moves the leg a little or not at all rather than throwing it across the
street."""
