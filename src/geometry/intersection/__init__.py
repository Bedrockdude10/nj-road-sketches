"""Build an IntersectionModel - legs, curb lines, corner fillets, context parcels -
from a site's config.yaml + the data sources it points to. Shared by every phase.

    junction      what a junction IS once built: the model and its value types. Loads nothing.
    kerb_sources  getting the traced kerb out of OSM and into state-plane feet
    paved         driveways, aisles and lots - the minor carriageways drawn as asphalt
    osm_roads     tying legs to NJDOT's SRI centrelines and to OSM's ways
    fitting       resizing, centring and joining the legs onto the traced kerbs
    load          load_intersection_model, which is the order those steps happen in

Layering: junction <- kerb_sources <- {paved, fitting}, junction <- osm_roads, load on top.
The order inside load is load-bearing: each step measures against what the last one produced.
