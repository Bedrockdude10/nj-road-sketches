    Match centerline pieces (all sharing one SRI, split at the intersection) to
    the configured leg names that reference that SRI, by nearest compass bearing.
    Generalizes to any number of pieces per SRI (2 for a through road, 1 for a
    dead-end/stub leg) and any intersection shape - nothing here assumes a
    4-way or perpendicular roads, only that each leg's config entry has an
    accurate `bearing_deg`.

    THE COUNTS HAVE TO MATCH, and when they do not it is a config error worth naming.
    A road network splits an SRI at the junction into as many pieces as there are
    approaches on it; the config says how many legs it has there. A disagreement means
    one of two mistakes, and both used to be silent or near-silent:

      MORE PIECES THAN LEGS - the road runs through the junction but the config only
      declares one side of it. This raised `min() iterable argument is empty` from the
      matcher below, naming neither the SRI nor the config. It is an easy mistake where
      NJDOT's name for an SRI describes only part of what it covers: at NJ 31 & W
      Delaware Ave, NJDOT carries the whole of Delaware Ave under one SRI called
      "E DELAWARE AVE", so the obvious reading puts the west leg on the neighbouring
      "PENNINGTON-TITUSVILLE RD" SRI - whose segment begins 334 ft west and never
      reaches this junction.

      MORE LEGS THAN PIECES - a leg declared on an SRI that has no approach for it here.
      That one never raised at all: the leg was simply absent from the returned dict, so
      it got no centerline, no curb line, no crossing and no mention.

    The leftover piece's bearing is reported because it IS the `bearing_deg` the missing
    leg needs, so the message contains the fix rather than just the diagnosis.
