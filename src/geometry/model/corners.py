"""Corner fillets, and the pavement polygon they close.

The junction's shape is built from one fillet per corner - a tangent arc between two legs' kerb
lines - and build_pavement_polygon rings them together. A junction whose legs meet too acutely for
their widths has no such ring, which is a real limit of this model rather than a bug, and
_acute_corner_diagnosis exists to say so in those terms."""
