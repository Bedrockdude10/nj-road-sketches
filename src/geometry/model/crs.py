WGS84 in, NJ State Plane feet out, plus the buffering and radius clipping that has to happen in a
metric CRS on the way. Every distance in the rest of this package is FEET in EPSG:3424; this is
the only module that knows another datum exists, and reading a bbox in the wrong one returns zero
rows rather than an error - which is why the two constants live here and are imported, never
retyped."""
