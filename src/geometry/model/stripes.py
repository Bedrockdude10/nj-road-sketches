# The crossings here sit 21-42 ft out, past the corner, so a radius change never reaches them.
#
# DATUM: the extension is measured from the leg's NOMINAL half-width, not from the traced kerb
# at that station, and the two are far apart at a corner. The traced kerb flares through the
# return - broad_st_east's kerbs are 39.4 and 31.6 ft off the centerline where its crossing is
# painted, against a 26.0 ft nominal half-width, so that crossing spans 65.0 ft rather than the
# 52.0 ft the cross-section suggests. Extending from the nominal replaces the flare with the
# extension's own straight face, which is what a built bulb-out does, so the crossing falls
# further than the extension alone implies: 8 ft per side takes 65.0 ft to about 36 ft.
#
# How far an extension may be pushed is bounded by the travel lane it must leave behind, so
