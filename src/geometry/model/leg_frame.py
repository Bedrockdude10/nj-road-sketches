"""THE LEG FRAME: (station along the centreline, lateral offset from it).

Every marking in this project is positioned in this frame rather than in state-plane coordinates,
because a street bends and a stripe has to bend with it. So this module owns the Leg itself, the
conversion both ways (station_offset_many / point_at), and the two datums a position can be
measured against - the centreline, and the TRACED KERB (curb_offsets_at_stations).

Those two datums disagreeing is this project's most productive source of bugs: config says the
road is 68 ft wide, the traced kerbs say 44. Anything that asks WHETHER THERE IS ROOM must go
through narrowest_half_width_ft; anything that decides WHERE PAINT GOES measures from the
centreline. See docs/network-model.md, which proposes removing the contradiction entirely."""

# kinks is a rate, not a total. Measured over these three sites, the two kinds of kerb movement
# separate cleanly by rate and not at all by amount: the legs where the street genuinely bends run
# at 1:6 or gentler, and the two whose tracing takes in a corner flare or a parking apron kink at

# without breaking it: measured over the 36 traced leg-sides at the four buildable sites, the
# followed profile came CLOSER to the tracing on 32 and further from it on none - erosion is
# monotone in the rate, so no marking can move out - recovering 0.20 ft of mean standoff and up to
# 0.81 ft. The flares are still refused, by up to 9.72 ft on broad_st_east's left kerb against

    325 ft, off a pinch 318 ft out. What that bought was worse than the problem: the section was
    then sized over 130 ft and DRAWN over 325 ft, and the 195 ft it was never measured over had
    its paint amputated to keep it off the kerb. broad_st_east carried green for 180 ft of a
    425 ft leg, under 42 flex posts and a centre stripe that both ran the full length.

    A treatment applies to the street in the drawing. Sizing over that street is what makes the
    facility cover it, and the honest reading of the 16.58 ft figure is that the pinch is real and
    the approach takes NACTO's constrained rung because of it - a narrower lane the whole way, with
    its buffer and its posts, rather than a wider one that stops.

    pieces do not line up - which is the failure inset_line_ft and offset_band_polygon already
    warn about in their own docstrings. One grid, one definition.

    Bounded by the stations where this side's kerb is traced, because that is the only stretch
    where a lateral offset can be checked against anything. None where there is no such span or
    it is shorter than a single sample.

    A NEGATIVE start_ft is a request to begin behind the junction node, and it is honoured only
    as far as the kerb is actually traced there - see curb_station_span's behind_ft. Callers that
    start at 0 or beyond are unaffected, which is all of them except a through-running kerb.

    `beyond_the_tracing` LIFTS THAT BOUND. The bound is right where a side's kerb is unmapped
    because nobody has surveyed it: drawing a marking there proposes something on ground nobody
    has measured. It is wrong in the two cases below, and both were once refused here.

    A MARKING THAT IS A STATEMENT OF LAW. R.S. 39:4-138 forbids parking within 25 ft of a
    crosswalk whether or not a surveyor traced the kerb there, and a daylight zone that stops
    where the tracing starts is not a shorter zone, it is the same zone drawn incompletely -
    which is worse than not drawing it, because a gap in hatching reads as permission.

    AND THE JUNCTION END OF ANY KERBSIDE ZONE, because there "no kerb traced" usually does not
    mean "not surveyed" - it means THERE IS NO KERB. Every kerb at all five sites begins 12-58 ft
    out, and that is not a gap in anybody's survey: a kerb line stops where the carriageway opens
    into the junction. At W Broad & Louellen the southern kerb is traced complete, and it ends in
    a hairpin 63 ft west of the node - the tip of the island between Louellen and W Broad - with
    open pavement between that nose and the crossing. Reading that absence as "unmeasured" and
    declining to hatch it inverted the rule: open pavement with no kerb to define an edge is the
    STRONGEST case for a hatched zone, not a reason to abstain.

    So the bound is a statement about the SURVEY and the junction end is not evidence about the
    survey. What keeps this honest is that the outer edge beyond the tracing is the kerb held at
    its first traced offset - the nominal cross-section - so the zone can only be drawn as deep as
    the street is already known to be, and checks.PaintInsideTheCurb still has to pass.

    Measured at W Broad & Louellen, whose south kerb is traced only from station 60.3: the
    statutory zone runs 0-93.3 ft and the hatching was drawn 60.3-93.3, stopping 7.5 ft short of
    a crosswalk it exists to daylight. 92% of the zone was hatched and the missing 8% was the
    part beside the crossing.

    Outside the tracing the kerb is held at the offset it has where the tracing begins, which is
    what curb_offsets_at_stations already returns there (np.interp clamps) and what
    curb_edge_by_station already builds its end vertex from. So this invents no geometry that the
    rest of this module was not already using - it stops discarding it. The assumption is still an
    assumption, and it is the reason this is opt-in and named rather than being the default.

    THE DIFFERENCE THIS EXISTS FOR. A centreline offset is a constant; the kerb is not. On
    w_broad_st_northeast's south-east side the kerb runs 25.13 ft out at the junction throat and
    17.24 ft out 39 ft later - a real, mapped 8 ft convergence where two streets of different
    widths meet. A bike lane drawn at a constant 16.44 ft from the centreline held straight
    through all of it and left a hatched wedge widening from 0.87 ft to 8.68 ft against the kerb.
    In the render the lane reads as swerving away from the kerb it is supposed to be protected by.

    So a marking that BELONGS TO THE KERB - the outer edge of a kerbside bike lane, the parking
    lane against it - is measured from the kerb, and the variable part of the section is absorbed
    where a designer would put it: the buffer between the lane and the travel way. What must NOT
    be measured from here is anything that belongs to the travel lane, or the travel lane inherits
    the kerb's wobble and stops holding its target width.

    `floor_ft` IS WHAT KEEPS THIS ONE-DIRECTIONAL, and it matters more than it looks. A section is
    sized at the leg's NARROWEST traced point, so that position is the one place it is known to
    fit; following the kerb is only ever about the stations where the street has MORE room. Pass
    the section's own alignment-referenced offset here and the marking moves outward with the kerb
    and never inward past its design. Without it, a station where the sampled kerb comes inside the
    narrowest figure compresses the whole section - on broad_st_east's right kerb the lane's outer
    stripe and its buffer stripe converged and ran along each other for 2.3 ft, which

    established this as a property of the frame rather than a defect: around a kink there is a band
    of stations no offset can reach.

    It only bites at LARGE offsets, which is why it surfaced when the bike lane's edges moved onto
    the kerb. broad_st_east's centreline kinks 4.5 deg at station 43.2 and that edge sits 28 ft out;
    one vertex, asked for station 42.5, landed back at 38.96. The line stays SIMPLE - it does not

    """World points that MEASURE BACK as (station, offset), not merely that were built from it.

    point_at and station_offset_many are inverses along a straight centerline and drift apart
    near a kink, because they resolve the ambiguity differently: point_at extrapolates the frame
    of the segment the station falls on, while station_offset_many assigns a point to whichever
    segment it is perpendicular-nearest to. In the wedge outside a bend those are different
    segments, and the further from the centerline the wider the gap.

    It matters here and not for a traced kerb because a traced kerb's stations were DERIVED by
    station_offset_many from surveyed points, so they agree with it by construction. An extension
    imposes stations instead, at ±19 ft of offset, and broad_st_east's centerline kinks 4.5 deg
    43.1 ft out where NJDOT rounds the corner: a vertex placed at station 44.0 read back at
    41.59, and across the taper's 0.2 ft-per-ft slope that is 0.59 ft of offset - enough to put
    the kerbside hatching built against this kerb 0.6 ft over it, which check_paint_inside_the_curb
    duly caught.

    So the placement is corrected against the measuring frame rather than trusted: place, measure,
    move by the residual. Everything downstream - the paint, the crossing reach, the invariants -
    measures with station_offset_many, so that is the frame the geometry has to be right in.

    Corrected per point and only where it HELPS. The two frames do not merely drift: at an offset
    larger than the bend's radius of curvature the offset curve FOLDS, and inside the fold the
    station order reverses - on broad_st_east's right kerb, 19 ft in from the bend at station
    43.1, asking for station 42 lands at 44.35 and asking for 44 lands at 41.59. A correction step
    across that discontinuity overshoots instead of converging, so each point keeps whichever
    estimate measures closest to what was asked and the fold is left alone rather than chased.

    """Which of these placed points MEASURE BACK as the (station, offset) they were asked for.

    place_in_measured_frame keeps whichever estimate lands closest and leaves a fold alone
    rather than chasing it - see its last paragraph. That is the right thing to do with a point
    that has to exist, and the wrong thing to do with one that does not: inside a fold there is
    no point at the asked-for station at all, so the closest estimate is a fiction, and a line
    drawn through it carries a phantom kink.

    So this is the second half of that decision. A line whose vertex density is a sampling
    choice - a kerb sampled through an untraced gap, a strip's inner edge on a station grid -
    asks here and drops what does not hold, spanning the fold with a chord instead. A line whose
    vertices are facts about the street does not ask.

    THE FOLD IS REAL AND LOCAL: an offset curve on the INSIDE of a bend of theta degrees
    self-intersects over 2 * offset * tan(theta/2) of station, and the OUTSIDE of the same bend
    projects a whole wedge onto the one vertex. greenwood_ave_south's alignment kinks 22.6
    degrees at station 355 on the 3x sheet, which is 7 ft of station at a 17.6 ft kerb and 4.7
    ft at an 11.8 ft lane edge - a few grid points either way, and nothing at all on a leg that
    does not bend.

    AND THE FOLD IS NOT ONLY AT BENDS. The other source is a leg END, where an offset wider than
    the leg's own start puts the perpendicular foot off the end of the line and every station in
    a stretch projects onto station 0: louellen_st_west's far kerb, asked for station 11.22 at
    21.4 ft out, measures back at -1.16. Same fiction, no bend involved, and it is the larger of
    the two - up to 19.3 ft of station against greenwood's 3.0.

    MEASURED BOTH WAYS, NOT BY ORDER. Station order alone reads as the sharper statement - a line
    that runs backwards is self-intersecting whatever the tolerance - but it is not per-point:
    scanning forward for the first decrease, one displaced point poisons every good point after
    it, which threw away a sample that measured back to its own station and offset EXACTLY
    (louellen station 31.22, d_s 0.00, d_o 0.000) because the sample before it had landed at
    34.04. The residual asks of each point only what that point did.
