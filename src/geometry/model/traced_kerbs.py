# How finely the stretch BETWEEN two traced vertices is sampled. A traced kerb is a profile
# in the leg's frame - (station, offset) pairs - so a straight WORLD segment joining two of
# them means "constant offset" only while the centerline runs straight between them. OSM
# traces the block and not the kerb (SKILLS.md #7), so those gaps get long: greenwood_ave_south
# is traced to station 113.9 and then not again until the frame cuts the way at 387.8, and the
# alignment curves through the 274 ft in between.
#
# ONE KERB, READ TWO WAYS, IN TWO FRAMES. The pavement ring, the corner fillets and the 3D
# kerb are built from this LINE; every marking is placed against curb_offsets_at_stations,
# which interpolates the SAME vertices in the leg's frame. Across that gap the chord stood
# ~10 ft from the profile, and nothing downstream could see it, because each side was
# internally consistent - the rendered leg carried 10 ft of bare asphalt outside the hatching
# on one kerb and hatching over the sidewalk on the other. Sampling the gap in the frame the
# kerb is defined in makes the two the same line again.
#
# The step is a chord-height budget, not a taste: a sample every 10 ft departs an arc of
# radius R by 100/(8R) ft, so 0.02 ft on the ~940 ft curve above and less on anything
# straighter. Where the centerline IS straight the samples land on the chord and nothing moves,
# which is why this changes no other site.

# THE ROAD rather than describing it.
#
# BETWEEN TWO TRACED VERTICES THE OSM WAY IS A STRAIGHT WORLD SEGMENT. That is the datum, not an
# artefact of it, so bending it toward the alignment everywhere makes a well-traced kerb WORSE:
# sampled unconditionally, louellen_st_west's right kerb left the way it was traced from by 1.31
# ft, and broad_st_east's by 0.16, where both had lain exactly on it. Only where the tracing is
# so sparse that it cannot be describing the road does the alignment know better.
#
# The two cases separate cleanly, and the survey behind stripes.py's chord_deviates is the
# measurement: greenwood_ave_south's two sides stand 9.6-10.9 ft off the smooth curve and every
# other leg-side in this dataset under 1.2 ft. So 2 ft sits in an empty gap between hand-tracing
# noise and a chord cutting a corner off the street - and a leg on the near side of it keeps
# EXACTLY the kerb it had, with its pavement ring, corner fillets, frame and goldens.
