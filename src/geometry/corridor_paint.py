"""THE FACILITY PAINTED ALONG A ROAD, not along a leg.

A treatment targets one kerb of one approach, and an approach is a 130-170 ft stub. Broad Street
is 3,693 ft with 91% of both kerbs traced - the survey is four times ahead of what can be drawn,
and a corridor drawing made from leg paint shows a protected bikeway appearing and vanishing
three times along a street it is supposed to run the length of.

WHY NOT JUST CARRY THE LEGS FURTHER. At ROAD_SKETCHES_FRAME_SCALE=2.5 the legs reach 325-425 ft and
the junction still builds; at 4 and 5 it DOES NOT BUILD AT ALL. Four legs each carrying their
own full-width envelope out of one node have envelopes that cross once they are long enough and
the street bends. The corner-fillet model is the ceiling, at roughly a tenth of the corridor.

A road has no such ceiling, because away from a node there is no fillet: there is a centreline,
two traced kerbs, and a cross-section between them.

WHAT IS NOT REDEFINED HERE. The cross-section is `treatments.bikeways.BikeLane` and its subclass -
`offsets_from_kerb_ft()` and `section_ft` are asked of the same class, so the corridor and the
junctions cannot come to different answers about where the stripes go. This module owns only
WHERE the section is placed. The junction detail in a corridor drawing comes from the junction
models; this supplies the run between them.
