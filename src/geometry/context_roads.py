"""The streets around the junction, built from the kerb that was actually traced.

WHAT A CONTEXT ROAD IS. One OSM highway way, widened into asphalt from the traced kerbs:

  * BOTH sides traced - West and East Broad Street - and the surface is measured.
  * ONE side traced - mirrored at the class-assumed half width. Surface flagged assumed.
  * NEITHER traced - Model Ave, Railroad Pl - a plain ribbon at the assumed width.

"Is this kerb ours" has had two answers (near the centre; along a leg). Drawing needs a third:
**is it in the picture**. A kerb 400 ft down Broad St is not this junction's corner return and
not on a modelled leg, but it is a fact somebody surveyed, and a drawing that omits it is worse
than one that includes it.

A kerb vertex is assigned to the NEAREST road centreline, not to every road within reach -
without that, Broad St claims Railroad Place's kerbs across the back of a lot.

The modelled pavement is subtracted from every surface this builds, so measured geometry always
wins where the two overlap.
