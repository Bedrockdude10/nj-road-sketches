"""What OSM says about a kerb: whether it is raised, and where it is dropped for a vehicle.

Stations are feet along a leg's centreline; geometry is NJ state-plane feet.

TWO SIGNALS, BOTH READ. A driveway is mapped twice over: as a `highway=service` +
`service=driveway` way running up to the road, and as the stretch of kerb it crosses being tagged
`kerb=lowered`. Reading only the kerb leaves the markings running straight across a driveway whose
kerb nobody tagged; reading only the driveway loses the many dropped kerbs no service way reaches.
So both open the markings, and each opening records WHICH source put it there
(`KerbOpening.source`).

DATUM: a dropped kerb's extent is SURVEYED; a service way is a centreline with no width, so its
mouth is ASSUMED (DRIVEWAY_WIDTH_FT). Where both describe the same mouth the surveyed span wins.
`describe_kerb_openings` says which is which, and flags a driveway with no dropped kerb tagged at
its mouth as the survey gap it is.

A PEDESTRIAN RAMP IS ALSO A LOWERED KERB, and it must not open the paint: a crosswalk's kerb ramp
is dropped for a wheelchair, not for a car, and the markings there are cut by the crossing band
instead. This borough's surveyors separate the two EXPLICITLY and this module reads that convention
rather than inferring one - a driveway mouth is `wheelchair=no` AND `tactile_paving=no`, a ramp
`wheelchair=yes` and `tactile_paving=yes`.

The test is POSITIVE (see opens_the_kerb) rather than "lowered and not tagged as a ramp", which
decides two cases the looser rule got wrong. A bare `kerb=lowered` with neither tag stays CLOSED -
breaking a bike lane over it would be inventing a driveway. And a contradictory kerb - tactile
paving present but `wheelchair=no` - keeps its paint, because the safe reading of a disagreement
between two tags is the one that does not put a gap in a marking.

`wheelchair=no` alone is NOT the signal: every raised kerb carries it too. It means "not a
pedestrian crossing point" only once the kerb is already known to be dropped.

            driveway" is one "not open to the use of the public for vehicular travel".

        THE VALUES ABOVE ARE OSM'S, AND THAT IS NOT A COINCIDENCE. 1C.02(113)(b)'s own list -
        "an alley, driveway, or site roadway" - is the same taxonomy as OSM's `service=*`, so the
        negative arm of the rule is read straight off the tag, one enum value per tag value so the

        Everything downstream that treats a gap in the kerb differently must read THIS rather than
        testing `.source`, so a new source answers the question once, here, and every marking rule
        follows.

        The two affirmative cases are the two kinds of "junction of two highways": CROSS_STREET,

        driveway by this rule and an intersection in fact, so kerb_openings_from_model resolves that
        overlap in favour of the cross street rather than leaving it here.

        The "unless … controlled by a traffic control device" arm of 1C.02(113)(b) is NOT
        implemented, and STANDARDS.md says so rather than this pretending to be the whole rule. No
        driveway at any of these sites is signalised, so the branch would never fire, and a rule

    Three ways this declines to move the mouth, each for its own reason:

        in the kerb here, and widening a mouth to fit a gap that is not there would open the
        markings over a kerb somebody traced.
      * Nothing traced on that side at all - no bound to snap to, so the assumption stands.
      * A bound further than MAX_MOUTH_SNAP_FT out. "The nearest traced kerb is a long way off"
        means the kerb is unmapped, not that the mouth is enormous.

    the other, and taking the assumption for both because one end failed would throw away the end
