"""Does the drawing contain every surveyed feature inside its own frame?

The property, from docs/network-renderer-plan.md:

    Every feature the surveyor recorded inside the drawn frame is either drawn from its own
    traced geometry, or named in the notes as deliberately not drawn. Nothing is silently
    dropped.

src/checks.py cannot ask this: every invariant there asks whether the geometry we DID build is
right, and a feature that was never built has no geometry to be wrong about. Geometry is
state-plane feet throughout.

THE COMPARISON IS GEOMETRIC - "is there a drawn footprint lying along this surveyed way?" - and
must not become "which surveyed crossings did the render match to a leg". That shortcut re-derives
the very leg-gating that drops features, so it would report the same number forever and stay red
after a fix.

WHAT THIS CANNOT SEE. A layer with nothing surveyed in it reports no gap, so an empty fetch reads
as a faithful drawing. That hole is closed upstream rather than here:
osm_context.snapshot_for_site refuses a site whose window reaches outside the downloaded area, and
fetch_kerbs raises OSMDataUnavailableError rather than returning [] on an outage.
