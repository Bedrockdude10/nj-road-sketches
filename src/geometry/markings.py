"""Every kind of marking this project paints, and every channel a renderer reads, declared once.

The declarations live here and their relationships are checked at import, not by a test that has
to remember to look:

  * a marking's ROLE says what it is - a line, a hatched area, a drivable surface, an object -
    and every renderer decides how to draw it from that instead of from its name;
  * a marking names the CHANNEL it travels to the 3D render in, and its role has to match that
    channel's role, so a hatched zone cannot be routed to a list of lines;
  * every marking has a channel unless it is an OBJECT, which reaches the render as a prop
    (see src/render/props.py) - the one thing paint cannot carry across that boundary.

Channels are the keys in the exported JSON that scripts/blender/blender_scene.py reads by name.
Blender runs under its own bundled Python and cannot import this package, so that boundary is
data, not polymorphism: CHANNELS is the single declaration both sides are written against, and
their order here is the order they appear in the file.

#
# One table, because it is one question. A driveway, a parking aisle, a side street and the
# junction this drawing is centred on are all the same event - src/geometry/kerbs.py:KerbOpening -
# and every marking has exactly one answer for each of the two KINDS of event that MUTCD
# distinguishes. Which kind a given gap is, is kerbs.OpeningSource.is_an_intersection's answer and
# nothing else's; what the marking then does is this table's and nothing else's.
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# HOW FAR A PARKING STALL KEEPS BACK FROM A DRIVEWAY RETURN, in feet.
#
# NOT SIGHT DISTANCE AND NOT NEW JERSEY LAW. R.S. 39:4-138 prohibits parking "in front of a
# public or private driveway" and names no distance at all, so the statute is satisfied the
# moment no stall is drawn across the mouth - which STALL_DIVIDER's STOPPED row already does,
# and which is why daylighting.py has no driveway in it. This is the separate municipal
# clearance that keeps the RETURN usable: St. Louis 17.24 forbids parking "within five (5) feet
# of the rounding of a driveway" and Seattle "within five feet (5') of the end of a constructed
# driveway return". Both measure from the ROUNDING, which is what openings.OPENING_TRIM_FT
# already models, so this is applied on top of the trimmed mouth and the margin off the dropped
# kerb's raw extent comes out larger. STANDARDS.md carries both ordinances.
#
# THE SIGHT LINE IS A DIFFERENT QUESTION AND THIS DOES NOT ANSWER IT, which matters because 5 ft
# looks like it ought to. WSDOT's Exhibit 1340-3 wants 155 ft of driveway sight distance at a
# 25 mph posted speed with the sight triangle clear of obstructions, and a row of parked cars is
# an obstruction in it. What a cleared length L buys is L*(E-t)/(E-w) in the driver's eye setback
# E, the target offset t and the parked-car face w - dominated by the handful of feet in (E-w),
# so it is tens of feet on one leg and hundreds on the next and there is no constant to write for
# it. This one is scoped to the clearance it can actually cite.
#
# APPLIED AT AN INTERSECTION TOO, WHERE IT CAN NEVER BIND, on purpose: R.S. 39:4-138(e) already
# holds parking 25 ft off every side line and crosswalk. A clearance wired to one column only is
# one that goes missing the first time the other column is the one with no daylight zone behind
# it, and this table's whole shape is that a marking may not inherit a branch by falling through.

                        Section 1C.02) SHOULD HAVE edge line markings MAINTAINED across the
                        intersecting approach of the driveway

    The reason for (09) is what the line MEANS - it marks where the running lane ends, and that
    does not stop being true because someone can turn in. The reason for (08) is the same
    sentence read the other way: at an intersection the running lane genuinely does end, because
    the ground beyond it is another street's.

    (Numbering is the 11th edition. Do not "correct" this to the 2009 Section 3B.07, which is
    "White Lane Line Markings for Non-Continuing Lanes" and says nothing about any of this.)

    `clearance_ft` is a THIRD answer at the same event and not a variant of the first two: how
    far BEYOND the mouth this marking keeps back. Only a marking that stands for where a vehicle
    may be put has one - see DRIVEWAY_CLEARANCE_FT - and it is a property of the row rather than
    of the ground so that widening one marking's gap cannot widen everybody's.

    `why` is the clause, per row, so somebody checking this against the manual can see which
    sentence each cell came from without reading the code that applies it.
