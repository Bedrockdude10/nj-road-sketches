"""WHAT A PAINTED PIECE IS: one marking, its kind, and how wide it is actually painted.

The leaf of this package - `PaintPiece` is imported in ~20 modules and both renderers draw what
they are handed here, so nothing in this file depends on anything else in it.

`stroke_width_ft` answering None is load-bearing, not a gap: a FILL has no stroke, and a caller
that treats a missing width as zero draws a line the collision check cannot see. That is how a
marking came to be checked with no width at all.
