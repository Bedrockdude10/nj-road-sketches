"""WHERE THE KERBSIDE MARKINGS OPEN FOR A VEHICLE, and what a marking does across the gap.

A driveway, a cross-street mouth and this junction's own throat are all holes in the kerbside
paint, but they are NOT the same hole and the difference is visible on the sheet: a driveway has an
apron, so the hatching ends on the apron's fillet; a street mouth has none, so it ends square. Kept
apart by kind for exactly that reason - see KerbSideOpenings.

THE DOTTED EXTENSION LIVES HERE because it is what a marking becomes at an opening: MUTCD dotted
marks carry the lane across a mouth where a solid line would tell a driver the wrong thing.

    """{(leg, side): (0.0, end_ft)} - where THIS junction opens each kerb.

    THE INTERSECTION ENDS AT THE CROSSWALK, and that is the whole rule. A person reads a junction
    by its crosswalks: the box between them is the intersection, and the corner OUTSIDE a crosswalk
    is approach - the ground a painted curb extension is put on. So the mouth ends at that
    crossing's reach along this kerb, and only a leg with no crossing resolved at all falls back
    to the corner return's tangent point.

    PAINTED OR NOT, and that distinction has no business here. Whether a crossing is MARKED is a
    fact about paint - it decides what other paint has to keep clear of, which is `keep_clear`'s
    job. Where the junction ends is a fact about the street, and an unmarked approach still has a
    crosswalk on it: N.J.S.A. 39:1-1's, the one daylighting.py already measures R.S. 39:4-138(e)
    from by name on exactly these legs. Its position is context.crosswalk_estimate_ft, which
    reproduces all 11 surveyed crossings here to a standard deviation of 2.4 ft - and which
    rejected the fillet tangent point for this very job, at -31.5 to +41.7 ft of scatter. So the
    estimate is not the weaker answer being used for want of a survey; on this question it is the
    stronger of the two, and the corner return is the fallback.

    WHY NOT THE CORNER RETURN EVERYWHERE. The tangent point is where the KERB starts, and a
    hatched no-parking zone held back to it stops short of the crossing - which undoes the
    treatment, because the bare stretch beside a crossing is the parking space daylighting exists
    to remove, and because filling that corner IS the painted curb extension. It costs 15.3 ft of
    hatching on W Broad & Louellen's south kerb and 13.2 ft on Greenwood Ave north's.

    AND THE TANGENT POINT DIVERGES AS A CORNER SHARPENS, which is why holding paint back to it is
    not merely conservative. A fillet of radius R meets its kerbs R/tan(theta/2) back from the
    corner, so the same corner radius reads as 1.0 R at a square junction and 2.5 R at W Broad &
    Louellen's 44 deg Y: 63.7 ft along W Broad's northwest kerb, against a crossing that reaches
    32.1 ft. That left 31.7 ft of the statutory zone bare on the sharpest corner at any of these
    sites - the one where a parked car blocks the most sight line.

    IT CAN ALSO MOVE THE MOUTH OUTWARD, which is the same rule and not a separate one: at
    W Broad & Louellen the crossing is surveyed 43.7 deg off square, so on Louellen's NORTH kerb
    it reaches station 25.4 against a tangent point at 7.9. The 17.5 ft between them is on the
    junction side of the crosswalk however short the corner is, and paint there is paint in the
    intersection.

    Empty for a kerb that runs straight through, via junction_mouth_ft - MUTCD 3B.11(07)'s
    T-intersection exception, falling out of the geometry rather than written as a rule.

    bulge. `run(u) = R - sqrt(R^2 - (R-u)^2)` for a strip depth R, u measured out from the lane

    Deliberately NOT a kerbside strip. Every kerbside zone this cuts runs from `inner_ft` out to
    the kerb, so the obvious cut is the same strip over the opening's span - and that is wrong,
    because there is no single "the kerb" to share. Three constructions here answer that question
    and no two of them agree past the third decimal:

    - `curbside_strip_polygon` takes the kerb's OWN traced vertices (curb_edge_by_station). The
      fills use it, so over a traced stretch the difference is exact - but BEYOND the tracing its
      vertex list is just the two interpolated ends, a chord across a leg that curves. On
      louellen_st_west's left kerb, traced only from station 58.2 against a junction mouth of
      0-65.9, that chord cut 605.6 sq ft where the mouth is 893.3, and left 85 sq ft of daylight
      hatching standing in the intersection.
    - `offset_band_polygon` clamps a lateral offset to the kerb RESAMPLED onto paint_stations. It
      follows a curve out front and sags inside the traced kerb between samples, leaving a hairline
      of zone along the kerb - 0.005 to 0.071 ft of it at four driveways, a parking aisle and a side
      street across three sites.
    - EVEN THE SAME CONSTRUCTION OVER A DIFFERENT SPAN DISAGREES WITH ITSELF, which is what makes
      this margin rather than a shared construction the answer. A cut that starts mid-way along one
      traced kerb segment interpolates its end vertex in station-offset space, while the fill it
      cuts draws the world chord between that segment's two real vertices. On
      greenwood_ave_south's right kerb the two cross by 0.003 ft over a 12 ft cross street: 0.66
      sq ft of hatching survived, invisible as hatching, and PaintContext.rim then outlined it as a
      22.2 ft white line straight back across the opening - the exact defect this module exists to
      prevent, and the one a reader reported.

    So the cut is a plain band between two lateral offsets, and its outer offset is past every one
    of those answers. Overshooting was tried once before and appeared to make things worse; it was
    being clawed straight back, because the shapes were then clipped to a kerbside strip built with
    the clamping - so the overshoot bought nothing and left the cut's corners degenerate, and GEOS's
    overlay against the resulting doubled-back sliver is unreliable (a stroke measured 100% inside a
    fill whose own bounding box does not contain it, flipping in and out with the overshoot size).
    The clip is built here too, so that does not recur.

    WHERE A VEHICLE CROSSES THE KERB, the markings it drives over open for it. A driveway is not
    a place to paint a bike lane's green surface, a parking stall or a hatched buffer across:
    those markings describe how the kerbside is used, and at a driveway it is used as an
    entrance. The spans come from the traced kerbs' own kerb=lowered / kerb=flush tags - see
    src/geometry/kerbs.py for why a dropped kerb rather than a driveway way is the signal.

    HOW DEEP. From the travel lane's edge out to the real kerb, and no further in. A driveway
    breaks what a car drives over on its way in; it does not break the line that marks the edge
    of the running lane, which carries straight past. TARGET_LANE_WIDTH_FT is the inner bound
    because that is the lane every treatment here holds - TravelLanesKeepTheirWidth is the
    invariant that makes it true, so no kerbside marking on a passing leg starts inside it.

    THE ENDS ARE TRIMMED BACK AND ROUNDED by OPENING_TRIM_FT, so a vehicle turning in or out has
    a little room and the gap reads as an entrance rather than as a rectangle punched through the
    markings. Deliberately small: this is cohesion, not a swept-path design, and every foot of it
    is a foot of bike lane or hatching given up. The trim is clipped back inside the kerbside
    strip so it can never reach into the travel lane, whose edge line runs straight past.

    AND A HATCHED ZONE GETS MORE THAN A TRIM. The trim alone is a foot and a half at 2D scale -
    correct for an entrance, but it left every no-travel zone ending on a blunt transverse edge,
    which is not how one ends anywhere else in this project: at a crossing it ends on the
    crossing's own diagonal. So the fills are cut against `tapered`, the same band plus
    _opening_run_out, and the lines and the green against `driven`.

    NEITHER THE TRIM NOR THE FILLET IS APPLIED AT AN INTERSECTING APPROACH, and both omissions
    are the same point: they model a DRIVEWAY APRON, which is a thing a street mouth does not
    have. A street mouth's flare is its CORNER RETURN, already in the geometry - so adding an
    apron's trim counts the same flare twice, and sweeping a fillet onto it draws a driveway
    apron across the mouth of Blackwell Avenue.

    A zone that ends at a street therefore ends SQUARE, which is not a shrug - it is the same end
    zone_end_line_ft already draws for a zone with nothing to end against, and past it the
    statutory setback (R.S. 39:4-138(e), src/geometry/daylighting.py) has usually stopped the
    parking well before the mouth anyway.
