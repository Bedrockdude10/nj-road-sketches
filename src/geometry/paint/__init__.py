"""Every piece of curbside paint a DesignState calls for, built once.

THE GEOMETRY IS DECIDED HERE AND BOTH RENDERERS DRAW WHAT THEY ARE HANDED. A second construction
of the same locus is a second chance to disagree with the first; src/checks.py inspects this
package rather than rebuilding the paint for the same reason.

WHY THIS IS A PACKAGE. It was one 1,435-line module in which the 416-line PaintContext sat between
the vocabulary it emits and the openings it clips against, so a question about any one of the three
meant reading all of it. Split by the QUESTION each part answers:

    pieces    what a painted piece IS - one marking, its kind, how wide it is painted
    anchors   where on a leg-side a treatment may paint at all, and what is too small to draw
    openings  where the kerb opens for a vehicle, and what a marking does across the gap
    context   the machinery every treatment paints through, and the one function that runs it

The layering is pieces <- anchors, openings <- context, with no cycles - the whole graph is a DAG,
which the old module had no way to show.

Returns shapely in state-plane feet; each renderer converts.

EVERY NAME IS RE-EXPORTED HERE, including the underscored ones, because `from src.geometry.paint
import X` is done in ~30 modules and an import site should not have to know which file a function
landed in.
