        `add` subtracts the intersection mouths, which is exactly the ground a lane extension
        exists to occupy. Sent through there, every mark of a crossbike would be cut away by the
        rule that calls for it.

        The other half of BIKE_LANE_DOTTED_EXTENSION's CARRIED/CARRIED row: the marking laid
        inside an opening is never cut against the opening it exists to cross. This is that door
        opened to a caller that builds the ground itself rather than clipping a parent marking to
        it - which a lane extension has to, there being no parent marking spanning the box.

        STILL CUT AGAINST THE TWO THINGS THAT ARE NOT OPENINGS. A crossing outranks this like it
        outranks everything else on the kerb (`keep_clear`, every crossing in the frame, not just
        this junction's), and an apron is built ground that paint stops at. So a crossbike gives

        than needing an exemption written for it.

        `min_area_sq_ft` IS "A PART OF A MARK IS NOT A MARK" for an area. MIN_ZONE_AREA_SQ_FT is
        NOT that rule - it is a hairline floor for clip slivers, and at 1 sq ft it passes a wedge

        to be a fraction of. `min_length_ft` is the same rule for a LINE mark (the value

    Whether the zone still starts there is not knowable then: a later treatment's fill outranks it
    and takes the ground (`_clear_of_the_paint_already_down` rewrites pieces already placed), and a
    crossing or an opening can take the front off as well. So the line is placed hopefully and the
    question is settled here, once, against the geometry that is actually going out.

    keeps a line lying on a polygon's boundary depends on where the overlay nodes it. Widening the
    opening cut by a foot for unrelated reasons moved the coincidence and the line appeared. A
    drawing decision resting on that is a defect whichever way the luck falls, so the rule is
    stated instead of left to the overlay.
