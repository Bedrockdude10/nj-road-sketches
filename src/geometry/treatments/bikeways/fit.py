Pure arithmetic on a section and a traced kerb: no treatment, no design state being mutated, so a
scenario can ask these before committing to anything. THE ANSWERS ARE ORDERED OUTWARD FROM THE

fixed because it is what a post stands in, and the bike lane takes what is left.

    divider mid-way through whatever the section leaves is the obvious rule and it is the wrong
    one on a wide street: Broad St's west leg has 52.5 ft between kerbs, so an equal split gave
    two 18.35 ft travel lanes, and an 18 ft lane invites exactly the speed this whole project
    exists to reduce. Spare width beside a travel lane is not the travel lane's - it is parking,
    or it is hatched - which is the same accounting a bike lane and an 8 ft stall already get.

    Where the leg cannot hold two target-width lanes beside the section, it falls back to an
    equal split, because then the shortfall is the street's and there is nothing to allocate.
    E Broad's east leg is that case at 10.04 ft a lane.

    CONSTRUCTING it, and the ValueError it raises is the refusal, quoted verbatim.

    HERE RATHER THAN IN corridor_paint, WHICH IS WHERE IT WAS, because both renderers ask it. The

    `CorridorFacility._place_on`'s policy rather than the mere geometric fit this used to stop at.
    `facility.sections` is declared widest to narrowest, so the last rung to construct without
    raising is the floor. A wider rung is only taken where it costs the far kerb nothing: this
    compares `far_kerb_surplus_ft` against the same `MIN_USABLE_STALL_FT`/

    `DesignState` to check. Before this, the strip kept the old first-fit-wins order and picked
    the widest geometrically-possible rung regardless: narrowing the junction sheets' bikeway
    left the between-junction strip's stall count exactly where it started.

    TWO QUESTIONS, AND THEY DO NOT BIND AT THE SAME STATION. Returning one kerb pair papers over
    that, so which pair is a real choice and both obvious answers are wrong.

    WHERE THE NEAR-SIDE PAINT GOES is the near kerb's OWN minimum. `near_half_ft` is the datum
    every kerbside mark is placed off - `travel_edge_ft = near_half_ft - section_ft` in
    TwoWayBikeLane.offsets_from_centerline_ft - so a section built on anything wider overruns the
    near kerb wherever it pinches. This function returned the min-SUM station's own near half for
    exactly one session, and the receipt is worth keeping: on w_broad_st_northeast at 3x that
    station reads 17.05 ft while the same kerb comes in to 16.12 ft at station 35.8, which put the
    outer edge line 0.84 ft INSIDE its own floor and 4.9 sq ft of white stripe on top of the green.
    markings_collide, fatal. The floor in AddBikeLane.paint holds each mark to its designed offset
    and the green to a band off the kerb, and those two rules only agree while the section fits.

    WHAT IS LEFT FOR THE TRAVEL LANES is the FAR kerb's OWN minimum, and the smallest SUM is the
    trap. min(near + far) is what the STREET measures at its narrowest cross-section, and on
    w_broad_st_northeast that is 2.44 ft more than the travel way ever gets: the section's inner
    edge is held on the alignment at `min(near) - section_ft`, because the travel lane's edge
    always comes off the alignment so the lane holds its width whatever the kerb does (place.py,
    lane_edge_line - only the lane's OWN two edges hug the kerb). So where the near kerb runs
    wider than its own minimum the surplus is drawn as bike-lane hatching on THAT kerb and never
    reaches the travel way. The drawn travel way is `min(near) - section_ft + far(s)`, whose
    minimum over the leg is exactly the two independent minima.

    THIS RETURNED min(near + far) - min(near) FOR ONE SESSION and the receipt is the point. It
    credited that approach with a travel way it does not have, promoted it from the constrained
    rung to the full one, and put the divider 9.45 ft toward a far kerb that pinches to 17.30 ft
    at station 48 - a 7.88 ft travel lane on a rural arterial carrying trucks, at 49 of 67
    stations. Nothing in the repo could see it: all three travel-lane checks either need kerbside
    PAINT to fire or clamp what a lane is entitled to AT the traced kerb, so a lane squeezed by a
    bare kerb could not fail one. ShiftedTravelLanesClearTheirKerb now closes that, and this
    arithmetic is what stops needing it.

    A near pinch at station 40 and a far pinch at station 300 DO describe a cross-section that
    exists nowhere - the objection that motivated the sum was right about the street and wrong
    about the drawing. With a constant-width section on one datum and a straight divider, neither
    kerb's slack is reachable from the other, so here the conservative pair is also the exact one.

    AND `to_ft` BOUNDS THE NEAR SIDE ONLY, because the two kerbs bound two different drawings.
    The facility stops where the reach stops; the DIVIDER it implies does not - a centre stripe is
    one offset per approach and it is drawn to the end of the leg whatever the green does. So a far
    minimum taken over the run measures the wrong stretch of kerb, and the tail pays: on a 3x
    w_broad_st_southwest the run stopped at 371.5 ft where the far kerb holds 15.95 ft, the leg
    runs to 389.9 where it comes in to 15.65, and the 0.30 ft went straight out of a travel lane
    already at its floor - a 9.65 ft lane under a design claiming 9.95, at 8 of 196 stations, with
    nothing in the arithmetic that had looked. Measuring the far kerb over the whole leg costs
    33.9 ft of that approach's protected lane and buys a divider that holds everywhere it is
    drawn. It changes nothing at 1x or 2.5x, where every corridor approach reaches the end of its
    kerb and the two stretches are the same stretch.

    Falls back to each side's own minimum where there is nothing traced to measure, which is
    narrowest_half_width_ft's nominal answer - no measurement, so no reason to prefer a pairing.
