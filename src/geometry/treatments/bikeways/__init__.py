"""BIKEWAYS: the cross-sections, the treatments that place them, and whether one fits.

WHY THIS IS A PACKAGE. It was one 1,552-line module holding four unrelated questions plus a
369-line treatment, so a question about the standards figures meant scrolling past the paint. Split
by the QUESTION each part answers:

    sections          what a bikeway IS in cross-section, and every figure that sizes one
    fit               whether a section fits this kerb, and what it leaves
    symbols           the bike symbol and the contraflow dash
    place             the treatments that place a bikeway, and all the paint one puts down
    divider           where the travel-lane divider sits once a two-way lane took one kerbside
    bollards          what stands in the buffer
    through_junction  carrying a lane across the junction

The layering is sections, symbols <- fit <- place <- divider, bollards, through_junction, with no
cycles - the whole graph is a DAG, which the old module had no way to show. `divider` and
`through_junction` are above `place` because they read the treatments a state ENDED UP with; the
sections below it can be asked anything without a state at all.

EVERY NAME IS RE-EXPORTED HERE, including the underscored ones, because an import site should not
have to know which file a function landed in.
