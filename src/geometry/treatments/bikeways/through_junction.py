"""CARRYING A LANE ACROSS THE JUNCTION: the crossbike and what closes the gap.

A bikeway that stops at the junction mouth and resumes on the far side is two facilities on the
sheet, so this extends one into the other. THE EXTENSION IS SURFACE, NOT JUST DOTS: measured, two
legs' green once sat 80.3 ft apart with 0.0 sq ft between them and dotted lines only, which reads
as a gap to every reader and to `--continuity`.

Above `place` because it needs the lanes it is joining to already exist on the state.

    THE ONE OPENING THE TABLE COULD NOT REACH. markings.AT_AN_OPENING gives BIKE_LANE_SURFACE
    `DOTTED / DOTTED`, and PaintContext._dashes_across_openings has always laid the green back
    across a driveway and a side street. It could never lay it across THIS junction, for a
    geometric reason rather than a standards one, and STANDARDS.md said so: a lane is built leg
    by leg, so at the junction each leg's green simply ends at its own corner return and there is
    no single marking spanning the mouth for an extension to be the continuation OF. The dash
    machinery is explicit about refusing that case - see _dash_spans_along, "a lane that simply
    ENDS at an opening has nothing to extend", which is the guard that stopped the stubs. That
    guard is right and is untouched here. What was missing was the marking it should have been
    extending: this builds it.

    MEASURED, at the two junctions that need it. Broad & Greenwood's north kerb: the east leg's
    green stops at station 26.83 and the west leg's at 22.21, so 49 ft of a continuous corridor
    facility was drawn as nothing. W Broad & Louellen: 12.70 and 68.30, and 81 ft - the longer
    because that junction is a Y whose crossing is surveyed 43.7 deg off square. At E Broad &
    Princeton the corridor kerb has no mouth at all (Princeton Ave is a stem on the far side), so
    the two legs' green already runs on through the node and this correctly draws nothing.

    WHY STRAIGHT, over a span that long. The extension is RULED between the two end
    cross-sections - each edge a straight line from one leg's lane edge to the other's - rather
    than curved to follow the kerb between them. That is not a simplification: at a junction
    there IS no kerb between them, which is what the mouth means, and a crossing is drawn
    straight across the ground it crosses. The corridor legs at Louellen are 170.9 deg apart, so
    the chord runs about 3 ft off where a curve through the node would, well inside the lane's
    own 12 ft - and the alternative, a marking that curves through a junction because the street
    either side of it does, is exactly the wobble a striper does not paint.

    GREEN, THE TWO EDGE LINES AND THE CONTRAFLOW STRIPE - the whole crossbike NACTO asks for.
    The edge lines are the same construction as the green against a different pair of offsets:
    half a stripe outside each face, which is where BikeLane puts every other `*_line_ft` and
    the one thing that has to be got right here, because a line ruled along the face it marks
    paints half its body over the colour it bounds. See `rules` in paint.
