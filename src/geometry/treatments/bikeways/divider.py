"""WHERE THE TRAVEL-LANE DIVIDER SITS once a section has taken one kerbside for itself.

ONE DEFINITION, because four things need it and they must agree: the two travel-lane checks in
src/checks.py, the plan view's lane dimension label, and the centreline paint both views draw. The
label was the one that got it wrong - it measured the lane from the ALIGNMENT and printed
"lane 9.6 ft" beside a lane the geometry had built at 11.00 ft.

Its own file because it is a question about the RESOLVED design rather than about a section: it
reads the treatments a state ended up with, so it sits above them and not beside them.

    of a leg see the same shift in opposite directions, and anything that ignores the sign is
    wrong on exactly one of them.

    ASKED OF THE SECTION, and of EVERY bike lane rather than only the two-way ones. A two-way
    lane was the first section to shift the travel way and for a while the only one, so this
    looked up AddTwoWayBikeLane by name; NJ 35 NB shifts it with a one-way lane behind angled
    parking, and while that lookup stood, the design was drawn shifted and CHECKED unshifted.
    BikeLane.divider_shift_ft returns 0.0 for an unpinned section, so widening the lookup moves
    nothing on the legs that were already covered.

    The one home for a sum that had three, and the two wrong copies did not agree with the drawing.
    Everything that has to know where the travel way ends asks here: the kerb-opening cutter, the
    paint checks, and anything sizing a kerbside zone.

    TARGET_LANE_WIDTH_FT from the alignment on every leg whose two travel lanes straddle it, which
    is every leg of every scenario until a section pinned to its own kerb takes one kerbside. Then the sum is
    the DIVIDER's offset plus the lane's own width, and both terms move:

      * the divider is off the alignment by divider_shift_toward_ft, signed, so the two sides of
        one leg see it in opposite directions;
      * the lane is divided_lane_width_ft wide, which is the target only where the leg can hold
        two of them. w_broad_st_northeast cannot: it splits the travel way at 10.08 ft a lane.

    WRITING IT AS `TARGET_LANE_WIDTH_FT + shift` IS WRONG ON EXACTLY THE LEGS THAT SPLIT, and by
    the whole 0.92 ft shortfall. It reads as innocent because it is right on five of the six
    corridor legs, and on the sixth it put the kerb-opening cutter 0.92 ft outboard of the buffer
    it had to cut: the cut landed inside the zone, took all of it but a 0.10 ft ribbon along its
    inner face, and PaintContext.rim then outlined that ribbon as a 49.68 ft solid edge line
    straight across a 9.5 ft driveway. The neat swept fillet the other legs get comes from the cut
    starting INSIDE the zone; a tenth of a foot of sign error is the whole difference.

    Equivalent to the section's own `travel_lane_edge_ft` on the side carrying the lane, and this
    is the general form - checks.ZonesGiveWayAtAnOpening asks about both sides.
