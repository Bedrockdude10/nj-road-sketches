    This is what turns a painted bike lane into a protected one, and the position is the whole
    point: the posts go on the TRAFFIC side of the lane, in the buffer, because that is the side
    a rider needs protecting from. Posts in the kerb-side hatching would protect nothing.

    Requires a buffer to stand them in, and refuses rather than improvising when there is none -
    a lane with no buffer has no room for a post that is not either in the travel lane or in the
    bike lane. That is a real constraint and not a formality: E Broad St has 17.6 ft from the
    alignment to its nearest kerb, and an 11 ft lane plus a 5 ft lane plus their two edge stripes
    already account for 17.6 of it.

    The precondition is on another TREATMENT rather than on the street, which is why it is
    checked in apply_to: nothing about a spacing is wrong on its own, and what makes this
    unbuildable is the absence of a buffered lane under it. A treatment that depends on another
    is the case a self-validating constructor cannot cover by itself, and the reason apply_to
    gets the design.

        Started at target_ft, not at the zone's own start_ft. A marked leg's paint deliberately
        begins INSIDE the crossing so the crossing cuts its end (end_against_crossing), and a
        post is not paint: it cannot be trimmed by a crossing, it would simply be standing in
        one. target_ft is the first station clear of where the crossing actually reaches on this
        side.

        AND THE GAP HAS TO BE ADDED BACK ON A LEG WITH NO PAINTED CROSSING. There, target_ft is
        the junction mouth's own end with no striper's gap in it, which is right for paint - the
        mouth CUTS paint, so starting level with it leaves no bare stretch - and wrong here for
        the same reason the paragraph above gives. Left level, the first post of the row landed
        exactly on the mouth's lip (station 26.404 against a mouth ending at 26.404 on E Broad's
        south kerb) and whether PaintContext.emit dropped it came down to float noise in the
        band's own vertices. A post either stands in the intersection or it does not.
