    follows the traced kerb by construction. NOT by re-deriving the outer edge from the
    centerlines: that is only correct while the kerbs are symmetric offsets of the NJDOT
    centerline, which traced kerbs are not.

    Emitted as separate pieces rather than one ring: the renderer draws a polygon from its
    exterior only (scripts/blender/blender_scene.py:extrude_polygon), so a ring-with-a-hole would
    come out as a slab over the whole intersection.

    A SUPPLIED `pavement` is walked at its own boundary, because the edges above are the corner
    ring's and a crop of the network has no corner ring - so a window drew 0 sidewalk pieces
    while the 2D sheet beside it drew the surveyed footway, which is the seam this project
    refuses to leave open. Same construction either way: widen the roadway's real edge, cut the
