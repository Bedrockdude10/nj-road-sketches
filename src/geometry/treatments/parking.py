    `legs` limits it to the legs named, leaving the rest of the junction bare. Not a
    rendering convenience - a scenario that treats two legs of a crossroads and not the
    other two is a real proposal, and Columbia Ave is one (see
    sites/columbia_princeton/scenarios.py).

    Restricted (parking:*:restriction = no_parking / no_standing / no_stopping) gets crossed
    hatching - that kerb cannot hold parked cars, and a proposal that drew stalls there
    would be proposing something illegal. Everything else gets marked stalls: both an
    explicit restriction=none, which is a positive statement that parking is allowed, and an
    untagged side, which is the ordinary residential-street default.

    A RESTRICTION OVER PART OF A KERB gets both. OSM records a restriction that changes part way
    along a street by splitting the way, which is how "no parking for the first 100 ft from the
    junction" is expressed - so a kerb can be restricted near the corner and open beyond it. Such
    a kerb is marked for parking here, and the restricted stretch is carved back out of it by
    src/geometry/daylighting.py, which treats a mapped prohibition as a no-parking zone exactly
    like a statutory one: the stretch gets hatched and no stall is marked inside it. Only a kerb
    restricted along its WHOLE length is hatched end to end.

    That distinction is the reason this reads state.parking_restrictions rather than one way's
    tags. It used to take the tags of the single way nearest the leg's midpoint, so at Broad &
    Greenwood a no_parking restriction covering East Broad's first 79.5 ft was dropped in favour
    of the unrestricted way beyond it, and the render marked stalls where the mapper had just
    said there is none.

    "Unless otherwise specified": a side the scenario has ALREADY treated is left alone, so
    this can be applied as a baseline and then overridden per side.

    Side mapping goes through parking_restriction_by_side per span, which flips OSM's left/right
    for ways that run against the leg - without which half these kerbs would have the restriction
    painted on the wrong side.

    Getting this wrong is not a small error. A scenario here treated any prohibiting span as
    closing the whole kerb, and so hatched 90.4 ft of explicitly `restriction=none` kerb on
    broad_st_east while reporting it as "OSM tags it no_parking" - when OSM tags 79.6 of that
    leg's 170 ft that way and positively permits the rest. On a corridor whose viability depends
    on keeping parking, that is the difference between a plan and a non-starter.
