"""A FACILITY THAT RUNS ALONG A ROUTE, declared once and applied at every junction on it.

A Treatment targets one kerb of one approach, which is the right scope for a cross-section. A
facility is not: "a two-way protected bike lane along Broad Street's south kerb, the length of
the borough" is ONE decision about one route, and the junctions it passes through are not three
studies that each happen to reach the same conclusion. Declaring it per site duplicated the leg
loop, the kerb-to-side translation and the not-fitting policy, which is how one junction got
NACTO's constrained fallback and the others did not.

WHAT STAYS PER SITE: which of a junction's other legs get their OSM parking, the surrounding
scenario, and the notes about that junction. A facility states the route; everything a junction
knows and the route does not stays where it is.

TWO KINDS OF ROUTE DECISION LIVE HERE, because a street that cannot hold a new facility still
gets treated along its whole length: CorridorFacility places a new cross-section wherever it
fits, and CorridorCalming names the legs a route's existing cross-section is narrowed on. Both
answer "which approaches of this junction are on this street" the same way, off the configured
street name - see legs_on_road, which is the one place that question is asked.

#: THE BOROUGH'S TWO-WAY PROTECTED BIKEWAY, declared once; no site file restates any part of it.
#:
#: THE BUFFER NEVER GIVES, AND THE WIDTH DOES. "Protected" is the claim the whole facility makes,
#: so a rung that drops the buffer is not a cheaper version of this design - it is a different
#: design, paint beside 30 mph traffic, on the corridor's hardest junction where riders need the
#: separation most. The width is the thing with a graduated answer: 5 ft per direction where the
#: street allows it, 4 ft where it does not, and the concession stated on the drawing either way.
#:
#: This reverses a width-before-buffer ordering that put an unbuffered 10 ft rung ahead of the
#: constrained 8 ft one, on the argument that 5 ft per direction with the kerb alongside beats 4 ft
#: per direction with posts. What that bought at W Broad & Louellen was 5 ft per direction and NO
#: PROTECTION AT ALL, on both W Broad approaches - the junction the corridor most needs to carry.
#: The constrained rung fits there: 60 posts, travel lanes still over the 10 ft floor.
#:
#: THE 8 FT RUNG IS THE DEFAULT, NOT THE FALLBACK - reversed 2026-08-26. "Fits" was the only bar
#: the 10 ft rung had to clear, and on a car-dependent borough that gave the 10 ft rung almost
#: every leg regardless of what it cost the far kerb, because a section a few inches short of 10
#: ft is not a section a few inches short of usable: it is a section that fits at 8 ft with no
#: cost at all. `_place_on` now builds the far kerb's parking (hold_travel_lane_at_target) under
#: BOTH rungs before choosing, and spends the extra 2 ft only where the far kerb keeps the same
#: usable stall it would have kept at 8 ft. Where 10 ft would hatch a stall that 8 ft would have
#: marked, the leg stays at 8 ft - the concession the rung ladder used to reserve for a kerb too
#: narrow to hold 10 ft at all now also covers a kerb that could hold it but only by spending
#: parking nothing required it to spend.
#:
#: NO INTERMEDIATE PART-BUFFER RUNG. Nothing on this route has room for one: a 10 ft lane with a
#: 2 ft buffer leaves 9.58 ft travel lanes on Louellen's northeast approach, still under the floor,
#: so the rung would refuse everywhere the full one does and add a width with no standing.
#:
#: TEN FEET ON THE FIRST RUNG, AND PARKING IS WHY. Hopewell Borough is car-dependent, so a plan
#: that removes a kerb of parking and returns none is not viable here. Over its first 170 ft
#: broad_st_east has 43.26 ft between traced kerbs: a 12 ft lane plus 3 ft buffer plus two 11 ft
#: travel lanes leaves 5.44 ft at the far kerb - under MIN_USABLE_STALL_FT, so the leg came out
#: with no parking at all. At 10 ft it leaves 7.44 ft, a usable stall.
#:
#: THAT PAIR OF FIGURES IS A 170 FT MEASUREMENT, AND IT DOES NOT SURVIVE THE WHOLE LEG. Measured
#: over all 374 ft the sheet draws, broad_st_east is 39.95 ft between kerbs and the 10 ft rung
#: leaves 4.13 ft - under a stall, so this leg is hatched on the drawing whichever rung it takes,
#: and the 12 ft one would leave 2.13 ft. So the argument above is the reason the FIRST rung is 10
#: and not 12, and it is no longer a stall this corridor actually gets: the parking it does keep is
#: broad_st_west's, 8 ft deep, which the section never threatened. Worth knowing before the width
#: is defended on parking grounds again - and worth reopening 12 ft on, which is 1 ft off NACTO's
#: ask, if nothing else claims that 2 ft. Note also WHY the long span is tighter: the section is
#: sized on the narrowest pinch anywhere along the leg, so one tight spot 300 ft out sets the
#: width for all 374 ft. A section that varied by station would keep both; none of this does.
#:
#: THE 10 FT RUNG IS NOT A NACTO WIDTH: NACTO asks at least 13 ft and gives 8 ft as the absolute
#: minimum, so this rung has no standing in the guide and the 8 ft rung is the absolute floor being
#: spent (STANDARDS.md 4). The alternative on the table was narrowing the travel lanes to 10 ft to
#: keep 12 ft of bikeway; it was not taken - see TARGET_LANE_WIDTH_FT.
#:
#: WHICH RUNG A LEG LANDS ON MOVES WITH THE SHEET, and that is the design working rather than
#: leaking. A sheet that shows more street asks the question of more street: W Broad's southwest
#: approach measures 20.32 ft over 130 ft and 16.58 ft over 325 ft, off a real pinch 318 ft out, and
#: takes the constrained rung on the sheet that shows it. The alternative was tried - freeze the
#: measurement at a configured span so the rung cannot move - and it bought frame-invariance with a
#: worse lie, a section sized over 130 ft and DRAWN over 325 ft whose paint was then trimmed off at
#: the first station it stopped fitting. broad_st_east carried green over 180 ft of a 425 ft leg.
#: A treatment applies to the street in the drawing; extent is the load-bearing claim, and the rung
#: is what gives to keep it. What may NOT move with the sheet is whether an approach is PROTECTED -
#: every rung here keeps the full buffer, which is what makes that safe.

    TARGET_LANE_WIDTH_FT with the recovered width painted as OSM says that kerb is used, hatched
    where parking is restricted and marked where it is not. See osm_derived_baseline, which is

#: run it down this street too. It refuses every foot it can test. Reproduce it with
#: `scripts/corridor_render.py --road "Princeton Avenue"`: over the 349 ft of the route where both
#: kerbs are traced, the constrained rung's 8 ft lane and 3 ft buffer spend 11.82 ft of the 30.13 ft
#: between the kerbs, leaving 9.15 ft per travel lane - under the 10 ft floor - and the route's
#: narrowest traced width is 30.0 ft. A conventional one-way pair is out on the same measurement
#: from the other end: 4.1-4.6 ft spare per side beside a TARGET_LANE_WIDTH_FT lane, under
#: AASHTO_MIN_BIKE_LANE_FT, so what would be drawn is a stripe that reads as a bike lane and is not
#: one. See each site's scenarios.py for its own junction's figures.
#:
#: SO BOTH OF THIS PROJECT'S USUAL LEVERS ARE UNAVAILABLE HERE, and that is a fact about the street
#: rather than about the section: Princeton Ave is a designated truck route (hgv=designated) past an
#: elementary school, so the travel lanes cannot go under the floor, and it is no_parking for its
#: whole length, so there is no parking lane to reclaim and the recovered width hatches rather than
#: becoming stalls. What is left is the width beside an 11 ft lane, which is what this places.
#:
#: NOT APPLIED AT ebroad_princeton, the route's third junction, where Princeton Ave arrives as a
#: stem: that site's scenarios paint EVERY kerb, E Broad's included, so the stem is already calmed
