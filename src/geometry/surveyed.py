"""SURVEYED CROSSINGS: every crossing the surveyor traced inside the drawn frame, drawn as traced.

The invariant (docs/network-renderer-plan.md): every feature the surveyor recorded inside the drawn
frame is either drawn from its OWN traced geometry, or named in the notes as deliberately not
drawn. Drawing a marked crosswalk as bare asphalt is a false statement about the street, not a
conservative simplification.

Geometry is NJ state-plane FEET throughout.

Not the per-leg path. src/render/crosswalks.py:crosswalk_axes reduces a traced way to
(station, skew) and rebuilds the band from the leg's frame, so it draws nothing at a junction this
site does not model and discards the way's own vertices where it does. Membership here is instead a
question about the DRAWING - the same argument src/geometry/kerbs.py makes for kerb openings: a
surveyed feature is already in state-plane feet, so it needs no leg and no road, only to be in the
frame. `leg` is CARRIED rather than required, so a renderer can still prefer the treated version
where a proposal restyles a modelled leg's crossing.

ABSENT IS NOT "lines". src/render/crosswalks.py reads OSM_MARKINGS_TO_STYLE with a default -
`.get(tag, "lines")` - so an untagged crossing comes out drawn with paint nobody surveyed. That
mapping is reused here; its default is not. No tag draws nothing, and `crossing:markings=no` draws
nothing for the opposite reason - the surveyor recorded that there is no paint. See is_marked.

The deprecated `crossing=zebra` tag is read too (LEGACY_CROSSING_MARKINGS); in OSM it says the
crossing is marked, so ignoring it renders a marked crossing as bare asphalt. A crossing way is
trimmed to the carriageway at the traced kerbs it crosses (carriageway_geometry_ft).
