"""Where a leg crosses ANOTHER street, and what that costs the kerb.

The fact needed was already fetched: `fetch_roads` pulls every `highway=*` way in range and has
been read only for `overtaking=no`; the geometry was thrown away. This finds the crossings and
hands them to two existing mechanisms:

  * a NO-PARKING ZONE either side of the cross street (src/geometry/daylighting.py), the same
    statutory rule the junction end already gets;
  * a KERB OPENING across its mouth (src/geometry/kerbs.py), the same mechanism a driveway
    already gets. NOT because a cross street IS a driveway (MUTCD 11th ed. 1C.02(113)(b),
    N.J.S.A. 39:1-1): the MECHANISM is shared; the RULE is not.

AND ITS CROSSWALKS COME WITH IT. R.S. 39:4-138(e) has two arms - 25 ft from the nearest
crosswalk, and 25 ft from the side line - and only the side line one was applied here.

N.J.S.A. 39:1-1 defines a crosswalk as "either MARKED OR UNMARKED existing at each approach
of every roadway intersection", so every cross street has two across our leg whether or not a
surveyor traced any paint.

WHICH SIDE. The side is read off the way's own geometry: which side of our centerline its
vertices fall on, near the meeting. A way with vertices both sides is a crossroads and opens both.

WHAT IS NOT A CROSS STREET. A driveway and a parking aisle are already PavedSurfaces and
already open the kerb. The junction this drawing is about is excluded by distance: its arms
meet at the centre and its setback is already applied from the side line.
