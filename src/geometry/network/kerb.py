"""WHERE THE KERB IS TRACED along a road, and where it is a junction corner instead.

A corridor's kerb arrives in pieces: OSM splits a kerb way wherever a tag changes, the tracing
stops short of every corner, and the corner returns themselves come from the junction model rather
than from OSM. This module turns all of that into `KerbRun`s - station ranges on one side of a
corridor, each labelled with where it came from - so a caller can ask "is the kerb known here?"
without knowing which source answered.

THE SPAN ARITHMETIC LIVES HERE, not in a neutral module of its own, because `_merged_spans` bakes
in `KERB_RUN_JOIN_FT`: two ranges closer than one kerb-run join are one range, whatever they are
ranges OF. A file called `spans.py` would read as pure interval arithmetic and would be wrong.

#
# A per-junction Road stops at its two legs' far ends (260-300 ft). Every corridor question is
# about the 2,400 ft between Louellen St and Princeton Ave, and none of it can be asked of a 300 ft
# object.
#
# HOW THE ROAD IS EXTENDED. Inside each modelled junction the centreline is THE JUNCTION ROAD'S
# OWN, vertex for vertex: the checkpoint above compares the road's width reading against the leg's,
# and the two only agree if they share a frame. Beyond the legs there is no fitted centreline to
# inherit, so the road follows NJDOT's SRI alignment, eased laterally onto each modelled junction's
# centre at the seam over fitting.py's THROUGH_JOIN_BLEND_FT.
#
# WHAT IS NOT INVENTED. The kerb is the traced kerb and nothing else: where the tracing stops,
# `width_at_ft` returns None rather than interpolating across the gap (see _kerb_offset_at).

# How far out traced kerb is collected for a corridor. NOT the junction fetch's 120 m: Greenwood
# Ave to Louellen St is 413 m, so 120 m circles leave 173 m never fetched. 400 m is the widest
# radius whose window still fits every site's snapshot area (500 m fails at W Broad & Louellen).
# at any member junction covers the whole block to the next one.

# Two traced kerb ways whose station ranges come this close are one unbroken kerb. OSM splits a
# kerb wherever a tag changes - at every dropped kerb across a driveway - so adjacent ways share
# an endpoint and must not be read as two runs with a hole between them.
KERB_RUN_JOIN_FT = 2.0

# Two kerb samples closer together than this in station are the same place on the kerb; keeping

    here cannot invent street.

    ANCHORED ON THE NODE, NOT ON THE SEAM, AND THAT IS THE WHOLE POINT. This used to take the end
    of the junction piece and return a reach measured FROM it. Both the search window and the cap
    were then relative to a point that moves with ROAD_SKETCHES_FRAME_SCALE, because the piece is a
    frame-cut leg - so a wider sheet slid the window outward and the corridor discovered street
    that a narrower sheet had not looked for. Greenwood Ave came out 1,695 ft at 1x and 1,891 ft at
    2.5x, and a facility's governing cross-section is taken over the span, so the sheet was voting
    on the design. A junction centre is a surveyed fact and does not move, so anchoring here makes
    the answer a property of the survey and leaves the frame to crop.

    THE CAP IS A RADIUS, SO IT IS APPLIED AS ONE. `max_ft` is CORRIDOR_KERB_RADIUS_M - the distance
    past which no kerb was FETCHED, and the fetch is a circle round the junction. Capping the
    arc length instead let the road run past its own fetch window wherever the street bends, since
    an arc is always longer than its chord: Broad St came out 4,655 ft with only 4,531 inside a
    window, and an opening count over the last 124 ft would have been counting where nothing was
    looked for. So a kerb point earns reach only if it is inside the circle as well as along the
