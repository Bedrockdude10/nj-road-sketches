"""A CORRIDOR: a chain of roads, bridged along the NJDOT alignment each end's leg was cut from.

STEP 2 OF docs/network-model.md, and the object that makes corridor questions askable at all: the
traced kerb is read side by side the whole way, so a fact can be stationed once and stay stationed
across every junction on the street.

BRIDGING IS THE HARD PART. Two modelled junctions on one street leave a gap between them that no
leg covers, and the two legs facing each other across it were cut from the same NJDOT alignment.
So the corridor follows that alignment through the gap and EASES onto it - `_eased_alignment` -
because the alignment and the fitted leg disagree by a few feet and a hard switch at the seam puts
a kink in every marking drawn over it.
