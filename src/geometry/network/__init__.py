"""A street as ONE object, with continuous stationing - through a junction, or through a borough.

docs/network-model.md, steps 1 to 3. Nothing renders from these directly; they exist because a leg
cannot answer a corridor question. A leg starts at the junction and runs outward, so a street
through a junction is two legs pointing away from each other, each with its own station 0. A
marking measured from one cannot be continued onto the other, and a fact that straddles the
junction has no object to live on.

WHY THIS IS A PACKAGE. It was one 1,636-line module holding four jobs, and the layering between
them was invisible. Split by the QUESTION each part answers:

    road      one street through one junction, as two through legs joined head-to-head
    kerb      where the kerb is TRACED along a road, and where it is a junction corner instead
    corridor  a chain of roads, bridged along the NJDOT alignment each end's leg was cut from
    facts     what is actually there, stationed once for the whole street
    area      every named street in a municipality, from OSM alone - no modelled junction needed

The layering is road | kerb <- corridor <- facts, with area alongside facts on top of corridor. There is exactly ONE back edge, and it is
deliberate: `_build_corridor` needs to know where the cross streets land before it can break the
traced kerb runs at them, and cross streets are resolved FROM a corridor. That import is
function-level, with the reason written at the call site, so the module graph stays a DAG.

EVERY NAME IS RE-EXPORTED HERE, including the underscored ones. `_complement_spans`, `_merged_spans`
and `_kerb_offset_at` are imported by scripts/corridor_render.py and src/geometry/corridor_paint.py,
and `_street_name` by treatments/corridor.py - the underscore records "not a designed API", not
"not used outside this file", so removing them from this list breaks four callers.
