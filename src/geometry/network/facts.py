"""STATION-RANGED FACTS on a corridor: what is actually there, stationed once for the whole street.

STEP 3 OF docs/network-model.md. Every question here is one that has no answer in the per-leg model
because the answer straddles a junction or falls in the gap between two of them: where the
driveways are, where the cross streets land, which stretches of kerb may hold parking, how much
marked parking a corridor could carry.

WHY THESE ARE READ OFF THE CORRIDOR AND NOT OFF OSM DIRECTLY. A raw OSM feature has a location but
no station, and a station is what makes two facts comparable - a driveway mouth and a no-parking
sign are the same kind of object here only once both are (start_ft, end_ft) on the same corridor.
