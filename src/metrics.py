"""What a design ACHIEVES, measured off the geometry it actually drew.

Every dimension this project puts on a drawing is an INPUT — the 55.5 ft street, the 8 ft
stall, R=20 at the corner. The outcome numbers live here, computed from the same resolved
scene both renderers draw from (src/render/scene.py:SceneGeometry), never from the config.

A crossing's length is NOT the leg's configured width: crosswalk_reach_to_curbs_ft measures
to the traced kerbs, asymmetrically (12 ft one way, 20 the other on a 30 ft street). Parking
stalls are counted over the PARKING_EDGE_LINE pieces the paint builder emitted, cut by the
entrances a stall may not be marked across - see marked_stall_runs for why the edge line alone
is no longer the run.

Nothing here decides anything. Every value comes from geometry some other module resolved;
this module only measures it and says what changed.

    paint already says where the runs are. A hydrant still does. A DRIVEWAY stopped doing it the
    moment the two markings were given different rows in markings.AT_AN_OPENING: the edge line is
    CARRIED across one (MUTCD 3B.11(09)) while STALL_DIVIDER is STOPPED and keeps
    DRIVEWAY_CLEARANCE_FT clear either side of it, so the line now runs straight past ground no
    stall is drawn on. Counting off it claimed 5 stalls at broad_st_greenwood that the ticks do
    not divide - in the summary panel AND on each run's own label, the two places that already
    shared stalls_in_run precisely so they could not be two arithmetics. They were not: they were
    one arithmetic over the wrong length.

    So the run is the edge-line piece cut by the same `openings.against(STALL_DIVIDER)` the
    divider builder laid its grid over (src/geometry/treatments/parking.py). Read off the drawn
    piece rather than off the ticks: the ticks are the answer, and a count recovered from them
    would have to guess whether a 21 ft gap between two of them is a stall or an entrance.

    AND THEN THROUGH model.stall_lane_runs_ft, which is where the ticks come from, because
    cutting by the same entrances only got the two answers CLOSE. broad_st_west's left kerb held a
    66.19 ft run - 3.008 stalls - and the divider builder holds its two end ticks
    MIN_LINE_LENGTH_FT inside the run, which spends 0.5 ft of it and lands on 2. Flooring the raw
    length agreed with the drawing on seven leg-sides out of eight, and disagreed on the eighth by
    eight thousandths of a stall. Trimming first makes every run a whole number of stalls long by
    construction, so the count cannot be a near miss in either direction.

    `openings` is passed in, never rebuilt here, so this cannot become a second answer to where
    the entrances are - src/render/scene.py:kerb_openings is the one construction. Without it the
    edge line is the run, which is the old behaviour and the right answer for a caller holding
    paint it did not resolve a scene for.
