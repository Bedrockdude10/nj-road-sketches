"""The schema every site's config.yaml must satisfy, as code rather than prose.

A config.yaml is the entire factual basis for what gets drawn, so its failures are silent:
the render confidently describes a street that isn't there. The three shapes each rule here
exists for:

  * A TYPO IS A MISSING FACT. `bearing_dg:` is not an error anywhere - the key is simply
    absent, and the leg fails several hundred lines later inside leg matching, naming
    neither the file nor the key. Hence `extra="forbid"` on every section.
  * A NAME THAT REFERS TO NOTHING. A crosswalk, signal corner or no-turn-on-red entry
    naming a leg that isn't there matches nothing and draws nothing, with no warning.
  * AN UNSOURCED NUMBER. Per README/STANDARDS.md, a width or radius nobody can trace to a
    source is a plausible-looking number, not a measurement; `source:` fields were required
    by documentation only.

Every site is validated on load (src/site.py:load_site_config), raising before any geometry
is built. Vocabularies are imported from their one home (provenance tiers from
src/provenance.py); the centerline styles are the sole copy, because importing them would
drag shapely into every phase script that only wanted to read a config.

This validates; it does not replace dict access. load_site_config still returns the plain
dict every call site reads - a gate at the boundary, not a migration. See load_site_schema()
for the typed view.
