"""What this project requires of each external data layer, stated as pandera schemas.

Every layer here comes from somebody else - NJDOT's statewide roadway network, Mercer County's
parcels, the county's MOD-IV tax list - and none of them is versioned, pinned, or promised to
this repo. A column gets renamed, a shapefile is re-exported with a different CRS, a download
comes back truncated, and the pipeline does not stop: it reads a missing column as an absent
FACT and carries on drawing.

That is the failure this module exists to make impossible, and it is not hypothetical:

  * `storeys_by_pin` asks for `GIS_PIN` and `BLDG_DESC`. Where the join misses, a building
    keeps a 7 m default and the render says "8 with no record" - which is indistinguishable
    from 8 genuinely unrecorded buildings and from a renamed key that matched nothing.
  * reading the parcels with a WGS84 bbox against a NAD83-State-Plane shapefile returns
    ZERO ROWS rather than an error. That looks exactly like "no parcels here", and it cost two
    round trips in one session.

So each layer is validated AT THE LOAD BOUNDARY, once, and a violation names the file, the
column and what was expected. `pandera` rather than more `pydantic`: pydantic models a record
and already owns `config.yaml` (src/site_schema.py), while these are tabular and geospatial -
thousands of rows, a CRS, a geometry type - which is what a DataFrame schema is for. The two do
not overlap and neither replaces the other.

TWO SEPARATE QUESTIONS, AND ONLY ONE OF THEM IS "FLOOR VS CONTRACT".

  1. WHICH COLUMNS MAY EXIST. `strict=False`: a column this repo does not read is allowed to
     appear. These are third-party files on somebody else's release schedule - NJDOT ships 16
     attributes and we read 3 - so an additive upstream change is not a defect here.

  2. WHAT THE COLUMNS WE READ MUST CONTAIN. Here it IS a contract. An all-null SRI passes
     validation and then matches no road on any leg - which is precisely the silent failure
     this module was written to stop. None of these columns is ever null except BLDG_DESC
     (12.4%, genuinely - vacant land has no building), so that is what they now declare.

The join keys carry a format check for the same reason. PAMS_PIN and GIS_PIN are the same
municipality_block_lot identifier in two files, and nothing else in the pipeline compares them:
if one side's format changes the join simply matches nothing and every building falls back to
one height. A regex on both is the cheapest place to catch a break that is otherwise invisible.

# value of checking it is that the two sides of the join agree; two regexes that could drift would
