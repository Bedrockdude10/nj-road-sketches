"""What the tax assessor says is standing on each parcel - MOD-IV, joined to OSM's footprints.

OSM gives this project real building OUTLINES and almost nothing about the third dimension.
So every building was extruded to one DEFAULT_BUILDING_HEIGHT_M and a render of a place where
half the houses are a storey and a half came out as a field of identical 7 m boxes.

The fact is on disk. New Jersey's MOD-IV property tax records carry a BLDG_DESC per parcel in
the assessor's own shorthand - `2SF` is a two-storey frame house, `1.5SF 1G` a storey-and-a-
half with a one-car garage, `B2S` a two-storey with a basement - and `data/MercerTaxList.dbf`
has been in this repo since before any of the rendering work, listed in the README as "joinable
by PIN, not currently used".

THE JOIN IS GEOMETRIC, then by PIN: an OSM footprint sits in a parcel (`PAMS_PIN`), and that
parcel's PIN keys the tax row (`GIS_PIN`). The rule is LARGEST OVERLAP WINS, which is
unambiguous here (the median building's best parcel covers 100% of it).

WHAT IT DOES NOT KNOW is said out loud rather than smoothed over. A building with no parcel, a
parcel with no tax row, or a description with no storey in it (`2G` is a detached garage) keeps
the default height and is exported as such, the same way a crosswalk says
`crosswalk_offset_source: geometric_estimate`. See height_source.
