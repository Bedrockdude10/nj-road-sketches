"""Where a label goes, and where prose goes instead - so a panel cannot cover its own design.

A label is drawn in POINTS and the street is drawn in FEET, and nothing reconciles the two: on
an 18 in sheet at 150 dpi one point of type covers 1.9 ft of ground at 1x and 4.7 ft at
--frame-scale 2.5, so a 40-character callout at 5.2 pt spans 235 ft - five times the width of
Broad St. The boxes crowd the 1x sheet and bury the 2.5x one. Measured on Broad & Greenwood's
2.5x two-way sheet before this module existed: a fifth of the bike lane's green surface lay under
white annotation and only 52% of it was still green, so the plan view showed half a facility the
3D render showed whole - two views reading the SAME PaintPiece list and disagreeing, because one
of them wrote on top of itself.

Which treatment a label gets is decided by WHAT IT IS, never by how big it came out. A size test
would be a design decision that changes with --frame-scale (.claude/SKILLS.md 0b): the same sheet
would key a callout at 2.5x and print it on the road at 1x.

  * PROSE - a sentence about a kerb - never goes on the carriageway at all. It becomes a
    numbered note in a keyed block, which is what a plan sheet does with prose.
  * A DIMENSION - "11.0 ft", "R=25 ft" - stays where it measures, but is pushed clear of the
    paint and of the labels already placed, with a leader line back to what it measures.

Both need the label's size IN FEET, which is a fact about the axes' limits - and those are set
after everything else is drawn. So labels are QUEUED while the panel is built and flushed at the
end. Placed as they were built, they were measured against a transform that had not been set yet.
