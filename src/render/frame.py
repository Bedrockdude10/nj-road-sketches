"""The one piece of ground both views are pointed at.

The plan view and the 3D render are the same reconstruction drawn twice, so a reader comparing
them is entitled to assume both pictures cover the same street. That only holds if ONE number
decides the framing, so it is computed here and both views take it: `plan_view.plot_design_state`
sets its axis limits from it, and `export_scenario` writes it into the JSON as `frame` for
`blender_scene.py` to frame its camera on rather than recomputing an extent of its own.

WHAT THE FRAME IS. The extent of the pavement this project modelled, plus a small margin. Two
consequences worth stating:

  * Vertices past a leg's own far end are dropped. The pavement ring is stitched from traced OSM
    `barrier=kerb` ways, which do not stop where our leg does - at E Broad & Princeton one kerb
    runs 425 ft from the junction off a 130 ft leg because the mapper drew the whole block as one
    way. A leg's far end is the edge of what was modelled; kerb beyond it is street, not junction.
  * It is measured from the MODEL, not from a DesignState. A curb extension moves the kerb, so
    framing on resolved pavement would frame a proposal differently from its own baseline - and
    these are published as before/after pairs, where a frame that shifts between the panels is
    exactly what makes two pictures incomparable.

The 3D camera is a tilted perspective camera, so it necessarily sees ground beyond the frame:
what matches between the views is the subject and the radius, not the outline of the visible
region. The 2D axes are square; the render is 4:3.

    - at Broad & Greenwood at 2.5x the frame reaches 131.4 m while context_radius_m(130) asks for
