"""Resolve the set of real texture/model files a render should use, fetching
them (via src/render/assets.py) in the project's normal Python environment. Blender's
own bundled Python has no network access / requests / this project's venv, so
blender_scene.py never fetches anything itself - it only reads the paths this
module resolves, REPO-RELATIVE so the exported JSON is not tied to the machine
that wrote it (see _portable), with every entry allowed to be None (asset
unavailable -> blender_scene.py falls back to a flat color / procedural shape)."""

    ONE MACHINE into every one of the 65 committed geometry files - all of them under
    output/.textures/, which is gitignored and re-fetched on demand, so on any other checkout
    they named nothing. Nothing failed loudly: blender_scene.py falls back to a flat colour per
    unreadable texture, so a clone rendered untextured asphalt and said so nowhere.

    Falls back to the absolute path if the asset somehow sits outside the checkout, because

    be a worse answer than an honest machine-specific one.
