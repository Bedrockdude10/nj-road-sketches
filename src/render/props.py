    NOTHING IS DRAWN THAT ISN'T ATTESTED. A prop appears only if its EXISTENCE is
    recorded either in OSM or in the site config's own observations. There is no
    "plausible default" tier: a junction with no mapped street lamps renders with no
    street lamps, and a junction with no mapped stop nodes and no configured signals
    renders with no traffic control at all. An empty corner is an honest statement that
    nobody has recorded what is there; a fabricated lamp is not, and it is
    indistinguishable in the render from a surveyed one.

    Two sources, in precedence order:

    1. OBSERVED - the site config's `signals` block. Direct street-view/field
       observation, and the only source that says where each pole and pedestrian head
       actually is. Supersedes OSM (src/provenance.py: if OSM disagrees with something
       we looked at, OSM is wrong).
    2. OSM - surveyed nodes and ways: highway=stop / give_way, highway=street_lamp,
       emergency=fire_hydrant, and the crossing tags below.

    Positions may still be DERIVED where the source records existence but not placement
    (a stop node sits on the road centerline and can't say which kerb its sign is on).
    That is different from inventing the thing itself, and every such case says so in its
    `source` string.

    Everything else OSM knows about the junction is used too, all from surveyed positions:
    pedestrian pushbuttons and RRFB beacons at the ends of the crossing ways that carry
    button_operated / flashing_lights, tactile paving pads where a tactile_paving crossing
    meets each curb line, and fire hydrants. Nothing OSM records here is discarded.

    Signals and stop signs are not mutually exclusive: a signalized junction can still
    have a stop sign on a minor approach, and OSM will say so if it does.
