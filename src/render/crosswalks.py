    1/cos(skew) itself while building its own rotated rectangle - crosswalk_band_ft divides by
    cos, blender_crosswalks.add_stop_bar multiplies by its span_factor. `lateral_offset_ft` is
    already ALONG THE SKEWED ACROSS-AXIS, because neither renderer stretches that one.

    Splitting the stretch across the two callers is what went wrong: each grew the span and
    neither grew the offset, so the near end landed at offset - span/(2 cos) instead of on the
    centreline, and each side carried a comment asserting the other's behaviour. At zero skew
    the two are equal and it never showed; on louellen_st_west's -44 deg crossing the 3D bar
    stood 2.15 ft the wrong side of the centreline, straight through the opposing lanes. Both

    stopped vehicle is in, toward the leg's own 'left' side (see

    approach lanes and at the centerline it meets the centerline. A bar standing off it leaves a
    gap with nothing on the other side, which reads as a striping error. Only the far end is held
    back, and only when that end is the KERB, because paint does not run into the gutter. Where a
    treatment has narrowed the lane the far end is a painted edge line instead, and a bar stopping

    crossing is not in front of motor traffic while they are in one either. `side` is a parameter
    because src/metrics.py needs both; entering_lane_width_ft is the left-hand case.

      2. a LANE NARROWING on this side, whose buffer is spare asphalt the bar stops at;

        the other.
      * The CROSS street's crossing. A taper curving into the corner runs into the crossing
        on the intersecting leg, which has nothing to do with this leg's own offset.

    So this measures against every crossing at the junction, restricted to the strip this
    leg's curbside paint actually occupies on this side: from inner_offset_ft out to the
    kerb. A skewed band reaches further along the leg near the centerline than it does at
    the kerb, and curbside paint never goes near the centerline, so restricting matters as
    much as including.

    `beyond_the_tracing` lifts the bound at the traced kerb, and only one caller asks for it:
    paint.junction_mouths_ft, which uses this to say where the INTERSECTION ends on a kerb
    rather than where a marking should stop. That is a fact about the street, so it must not
    be cut short where nobody traced the kerb - see model.paint_stations for the same
    distinction.
