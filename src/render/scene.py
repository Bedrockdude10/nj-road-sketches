"""One resolved answer to "where is this scenario's paint", shared by every consumer.

Three consumers read that answer - the 2D plan view, the 3D export, and the scene invariants -
and the premise of the plan view is that it shows what the render will show. So all three must
look at the SAME geometry. Resolving once here and handing the result around is what makes that
claim structurally true instead of a convention four call sites have to keep remembering; each
site looked locally reasonable while they disagreed, and the disagreements were only visible
side by side.

Nothing here decides anything new - every value still comes from the same function in
src/render/crosswalks.py it always did. The only thing this module adds is that there is one
of each.
