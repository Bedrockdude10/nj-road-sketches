    Gating mirrors scripts/blender/blender_scene.py precisely - a crosswalk is painted
    only on a leg listed in the config's `intersection.existing_marked_crosswalks` and
    not already carrying a raised crossing (which is drawn separately). Legs failing
    that gate still get their resolved offset drawn as a thin outline, because "this
    leg has no marked crossing" is itself a finding worth seeing in the reconstruction,
    and because a wrong offset on an unmarked leg is exactly the kind of latent error
    that only surfaces later when a proposal marks it.

    Surveyed (OSM) and estimated positions are drawn differently, following the same
    convention this view already uses for confirmed vs. estimated curb widths.

    Both footprints come from `scene` and are never rebuilt here - see src/render/scene.py.
    Rebuilding them draws them somewhere neither the render nor the checks agree with, which is
    the one failure this view exists to catch rather than commit.
